<h2 class="nobreak">Foreword</h2>
</div>

<p>These inquiries into German atrocities
were begun in the latter part of September,
1914. Friends who had escaped from
Belgium during the latter part of August
brought stories of German frightfulness that
filled all hearers with horror. Being unwilling
to accept their testimony without
further evidence, I began a careful research,
collecting letters, magazine articles, testimony
of eye-witnesses, books, photographs,
reports of the various commissions, by former
Ambassador Bryce and Professor Toynbee,
with those of the Commissions of Belgium,
France, Poland, Serbia and Armenia. Last
May, in the interest of the first Liberty
Loan, Mr. Lawrence Chamberlain and I
made a tour of eighteen states, speaking in
some thirty-five cities, and often giving two,
three and even five addresses in a single day.
Everywhere during that tour we found public
men raising the question, "What about
the German atrocities? Do they not represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
falsehoods invented by the enemy
states?"</p>

<p>In the belief that this question was vital
to the success of the second and all subsequent
Liberty Loans, and for the full awakening
of the American people, at the request
of several bankers of New York, with Mr.
Chamberlain I sailed for France late in
June, and returned to this country in September.
As guests of the British and French
governments we had every opportunity of
visiting the devastated regions of Belgium
and France, and those long journeys through
the ruined farms, villages and cities brought
the opportunity of conversing with hundreds
of victims of German cruelty, who gave us
their testimony on the very spots where the
atrocities had been committed. At the request
of Henry M. and W. C. Leland of
Detroit, and Richard H. Edmonds of Baltimore,
I have brought together this simple
record of the bare facts that came under our
own personal scrutiny. In the nature of the
case, many atrocities that were carefully
studied cannot be presented in this report
because the witnesses reasonably fear that
their families, just behind the German lines,
might be made to suffer were their testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to become known. It should be added
that Mr. Chamberlain will shortly make his
report from the view-point of the financier
and investigator of industrial conditions in
Belgium and France.</p>

<p>The first two of the following chapters
embody the substance of addresses given in
Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,
Chicago, Indianapolis, and some thirty
other cities during October, 1917, in connection
with the Second Liberty Loan. The
third substantially presents views of addresses
in Cincinnati, Louisville, New Orleans,
Houston, Los Angeles, Portland,
Seattle, Salt Lake City, Butte, Denver, and
thirty other cities during the First Liberty
Loan.</p>

<div class="center"><i>Did the Kaiser's Charge Render the Later
Atrocities Inevitable?</i></div>

<blockquote>

<p>When Charles IX of France was urged to kill
Coligny, he finally consented, in these words,
"Assassinate Admiral Coligny, but leave not a
Huguenot alive in France to reproach me." That
first assassination made the later atrocities inevitable.
When the Kaiser and his War Staff determined
to kill, they delayed for a time, but
once their hands were dripping with blood, the
first massacres made it necessary to go on, and kill
the Belgians and Frenchmen who had witnessed
the crimes. So came the unspeakable atrocities
of the Germans.</p>

<p>"Take heed that ye offend not against one of
my little ones. If any man offend against one
of my little ones, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and that
he were drowned in the depths of the sea."&mdash;<i>The
Gospel of Matthew (Jesus Christ).</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="center"><big>I<br />
German Atrocities, Their Nature
and Philosophy</big></div>


<p>All Americans who have journeyed
through Belgium and France this
year have returned home permanently saddened
men. German cruelty has cut a
bloody gash in the heart, and while there
are Dakin solutions that heal wounds in the
arms and legs, there is no medicine that can
heal the wounds in the heart. Some German-Americans
still insist that the alleged
German atrocities represent English lies, Belgian
hypocrisies and French delusions, but
all possibility of evasion or denial has been
destroyed. Modern courts are satisfied with
two forms of testimony, but the German
atrocities are evidenced by five kinds of
indubitable proof. There is the testimony
of men and women telling what their own
eyes have seen, and their own ears have
heard,&mdash;that is a high form of evidence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
There is the testimony of little children,
children too innocent to invent what they
are old enough to describe. Legal authorities
tell us that because children are unprejudiced
their testimony is the highest form of
proof known to modern courts. Third, there
is the testimony of the photograph,&mdash;photographs
taken often before the massacred
bodies had grown cold, and immediately
after the German retreat from the town
they had pillaged. The sunbeams move in
straight lines; they tell no lies; they cannot
be bribed; they have no prejudice for
or against the Germans. No one can look
at the hundreds of photographs of mutilated
bodies without confessing that the sunlight,
like a recording angel, has given a damning
testimony that cannot be gainsaid by the
monsters who not only killed men who defended
the honour of their wives, but hacked
these young husbands into shreds, mutilating
the body in ways that can only be mentioned
by men to men and in whispered
tones.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Germans Convict Themselves</span></p>

<p>Another form of proof is found in the
journals and diaries of the German soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
The German has climbed into the witness
stand, and given conclusive testimony against
himself. Had his statements been made by
Belgians, French or English, we would have
denied or questioned the words, but when
diaries have been taken from the dead bodies
of German soldiers, and when these different
journals contain substantially the same statements
as to the atrocities committed at a
given day in a given town, it becomes impossible
for an American student to deny
the daily records of German soldiers, with
the confession of deeds committed sometimes
by their fellows, sometimes by themselves.
There is also the testimony of mutilated
bodies that have been preserved in certain
morgues against the day of judgment when
arbitrators will behold the proof, hear the
witnesses, and weigh the guilt of the Germans.
The Day of Judgment is coming
when these witnesses will rise literally from
the grave and indict the German Kaiser and
his War Staff for atrocities that are the
logical and inevitable result of the ceaseless
drill of their officers and privates in the
science of murder, as a method of breaking
down the nervous resources of the armed
soldiers of Belgium and France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Overwhelming Evidence</span></p>

<p>No horrors in history are so overwhelmingly
evidenced as the German atrocities.
The nature, the number, and the extent of
their crimes have been documented more
thoroughly than the scalpings of settlers by
Sioux Indians, the horrors of the Black Hole
of Calcutta, or the cruelties of the Spanish
Inquisition. No American to-day can cross
the threshold of Belgium or Northern France,
Poland or Serbia, without recalling the words
that Dante saw above the gate of Hell:
"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here."
Not since Judas and his fellow conspirators
crucified Jesus has there been a ruler, a
War Staff or an army, that has deliberately
revived the cross, as an instrument of torture,
to further the ends of military efficiency.
The Germans have literally fulfilled the
Kaiser's charge in 1899, and reproduced in
1914, upon various cards for the Kaiser's
soldiers: "You will take no prisoners; you
will show no mercy; you will give no quarter;
you will make yourselves as terrible as
the Huns under Attila." All scholars know
that the Kaiser was referring to Attila's
well-known motto, "Where my feet fall, let
grass not grow for a hundred years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Catalogue of Crimes</span></p>

<p>The catalogue of German atrocities, now
documented, in legal reports, with the accompanying
photographs, preserved in the
Department of Justice of the various nations,
makes up the blackest page in human
history. Long days and nights spent over
the reports in the various capitals, and in
courts of justice, journeys to and fro amid
the ruined villages along a battle front six
hundred miles in length, leave the head sick
and the heart faint. The traveller would
become utterly hopeless and broken-hearted,
and give himself up to black despair, were it
not that everything that German savagery
has done to destroy one's faith in the divine
origin of the human soul has been more
than recovered by the gentleness, the self-sacrifice,
the fortitude, the sympathy, the
heroism of the British, the Belgians, and the
French. The Germans have at last compelled
all unprejudiced minds to recognize
the atrocity as the German notion of scientific
efficiency. It is not by chance that
the first atrocities were begun on practically
the same day, August 17th, of 1914, and
ended about September 19th, and along a
line extending from the English Channel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the Swiss frontier, just as the murders and
mutilations, the rapes and the pillaging began
and ended at the same time in Poland,
Rumania and Serbia, and are now being
repeated in more malignant forms in Northeastern
Italy.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">These Horrors Do Not Represent
Drunkenness</span></p>

<p>Nor were these atrocities committed in
moods of drunkenness, hours of anger, nor
by the occasional degenerate, like Jack the
Ripper of Whitechapel Road. Allen White
and Arnold Toynbee are doubtless right in
asserting that <i>most</i> of the attacks upon
little girls and young women were made
by German officers, nevertheless, all must
confess that the German soldiers were not
less culpable, as they pillaged the land,
guided by the deliberate, cold, precise,
scientific, ordered policy of German frightfulness.</p>

<p>The story of German occupancy of Belgium
and France is a long, black story of
unspeakable crimes. These brigands broke
into banks, looted factories, pillaged houses,
burned the farmers' machinery, chopped
down orchards and vineyards. In the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of their newly-signed treaties with the Allied
nations, pledging the safeguarding of all
buildings dedicated to education and religion,
with the lives and property of non-combatants,
the Germans made their treaties
mere scraps of paper, sneered at the most
solemn obligations given by men to men,
burned cathedrals, colleges and libraries,
mutilated old men and women, violated
little children, nailed a child to a farmer's
barn door upon which they found a calf skin
drying in the sun, and beneath wrote the
word "zwei." They crucified Canadian
officers and Roman Catholic nuns. They
bombed hospitals and Red Cross buildings.
They thrust women and little children between
themselves and the Belgian and
French soldiers defending their native land.
The affidavits, photographs, and mutilated
bodies are witnesses that destroy forever the
last shred of doubt and incredulity. For
men who are open to testimony, the German
atrocities are more surely established than
any of the hideous cruelties recorded in history.
Now, for the first time, wildest savagery
has been reduced to a science, and
damned into existence under the name of
German efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Philosophy of the German
Atrocities</span></p>

<p>At the beginning of the war the American
people questioned all these alleged
horrors, saying that all war is hell, and
abuses are common to all armies. Americans
looked upon these alleged abominations
as being intellectually absurd and morally
monstrous, and therefore we doubted the
evidence. But at last all alike perceive that
the German war-deeds differ from the usual
abuses of war, as a cunning fiend differs from
a drunken man. Germany believes in militarism,
in forty-two centimeter guns, in submarines,
in liquid fire and poisoned gases.
This republic and our Allies believe in
the manufacture of souls of good quality.
We believe in schools, colleges, libraries,
churches, factories, banks, fruitful fields and
a self-sufficing, intelligent and moral manhood.
From the Allied view-point, the very
thought of Germany's asking other nations
to produce property while once in a generation,
with her standing army, she goes forth
to pillage and loot the wealth that industrious
French or Belgians have created, is for
us a monstrous thought. From the German
view-point, however, atrocities represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
military efficiency. Just as the German
War Staff perfected in advance rifles and
cannon as legitimate warfare, so they prepared
in advance certain outrages from
which they expected the greatest possible
results, in terms of conquered territory.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The German Handbook of Military
Tactics</span></p>

<p>That their officers and soldiers might
understand in advance the use of the atrocity
as a military instrument, the General Staff
of the German army, in 1902, published a
handbook of military tactics, entitled "The
Laws of War on Land." This handbook
sets forth a deliberate system of atrocity,
and prepares the way for every species of
villainy. In clear and unmistakable language,
the War Staff presents principles that
embody the ideas of savages. Witness the
statements on page 35: "By steeping himself
in military history an officer will be able
to guard himself against excessive humanitarian
notions. It will teach him that
certain severities are indispensable to war.
What is permissible includes <i>every means</i>
without which the object of the war cannot
be attained." Witness also the savagery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
outlined on page 52: "A war conducted
with energy cannot be directed merely
against the combatants of the enemy states
and the positions they occupy, but it will
and must in like manner seek to destroy the
total intellectual and material resources of
the latter. Humanitarian claims,&mdash;such as
the protection of men's lives and their property,
can be taken into consideration only
in so far as the nature and object of the
war will permit." Their Handbook of
Military Tactics is, therefore, nothing other
than the science of atrocity. With an army
steeped in these vicious teachings, with private
soldiers trained by this handbook that
teaches crime as an art, and with the exhortation
of their Kaiser to make themselves
as terrible as the Huns under Attila, the rape
of Belgium, the crucifixion of Poland, and
the assassination of Northern France were
logical and inevitable results.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The German Motive for Massacre an
Overwhelming One</span></p>

<p>To-day, Germans find it difficult to forgive
Bethmann-Hollweg for his confessions when,
at the beginning of the war, he acknowledged
they were committing a wrong against Belgium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that their designs made necessary,
by "hacking the way through." We now
know that the motive of the Kaiser and his
War Staff for massacring Belgium was an
overwhelming motive. They had staked
everything upon a short war. "Brussels in
one week, Paris in two weeks, London in two
months,"&mdash;that was the programme. The
stubborn opposition of the Belgian army,
standing on a frontier whose sanctity the
Kaiser, by the most solemn treaties, had just
pledged himself to safeguard, stalled the
German military machine, made impossible
a crushing victory over France, and threatened
their dreams of a series of hurricane
victories over England.</p>

<p>Then the German War Staff put into
operation the instructions to "frightfulness"
against aged men and women, girls and
little children. Should the average American
return home at night to find that his
wife and children had been massacred and
mutilated during his absence, he would not
go to the office on the following morning.
The horror of "a great darkness" would fall
upon him, the tool would drop from his hand,
and weeks would pass before he could steel
his hand to the accustomed task. Now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
German War Staff fully realized the true
value of the atrocity as a military instrument.
Their soldiers ran no risk in killing aged
men or raping young girls, but they hoped
that when the news of their crimes reached
the armed opponent, the atrocity committed
upon his wife or child would break his
nerve, and leave him helpless to fight. It
took only three and a half weeks to spread
the black wave of terror and frightfulness
over Belgium, in order to break the nerve
forces of the Belgian army.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Number of Atrocities</span></p>

<p>The full extent of this can never be
known. More than one hundred thousand
people are simply reported as "missing,"
other multitudes were burned or thrown into
pits. Only in towns from which the German
armies hurriedly retreated were inquests possible,
and in those towns affidavits were prepared
and photographs of the mutilated bodies
taken. The fact that these atrocities all
along the battle line began on practically the
same day in August and ended on about the
same day in September does not prove, but
does suggest plan and prearrangement. After
the German troops had passed through, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
became possible for the village school-teacher,
priest or banker, the aged women and the
children who had escaped to creep out of
pits, the caves in the fields, or the edge of
the woods, where they had been hiding, and
return to survey the scene of desolation behind
them. In those towns where the soldiers
encountered no opposition by the inhabitants,
for the reason that there were no men
left in the village, the Germans speedily
wrought their devastation and departed.
Then the French authorities hurried forward
their authorized representatives, inquests were
held, photographs taken of the mutilated
bodies, and testimony taken and sent to the
Department of Justice. What took place in
those Belgian towns and cities that are still
in German hands will never be known until
the German officers and soldiers stand before
the Great Judgment Throne and give their
account unto God.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The German War Staff's Report Acknowledges
Their Atrocities</span></p>

<p>The value of the atrocity as a military instrument
for sending the simoom of terror across
the land is set forth in scores of diaries taken
from the dead bodies of German soldiers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
also from the occasional reports of German
officers to the War Staff, that were printed
in Berlin and found their way into this country
by way of Denmark, Norway or Sweden.</p>

<p>In the "summarizing report by the General
War Staff," published December 31,
1914, the German chief says in explanation
of the Belgian campaign: "The need of the
German army to push through Belgium was
imperative. Our starting point was that the
tactical object of the Twelfth Corps was to
cross the Meuse with speed. To at once
overcome the opposition of the inhabitants
was a military necessity, and something to be
striven for in every way." And what does
"every way" mean? Let the German Staff
themselves answer. "The flourishing town
of Dinant with its suburbs was burnt, and
made a heap of ruins, and a large number of
Belgian lives lost." "About 220 inhabitants
were then shot, and the village was burned.
Just now, six o'clock in the afternoon, the
crossing of the Meuse begins near Dinant;
all the suburbs, chateaux and houses were
burned down during this night. It was a
beautiful sight to see the villages burning all
around us in the distance." "The town appeared
to be perfectly peaceful, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
for the sake of security, a number of the inhabitants
were made prisoners by the grenadiers."
"Later, we decided to assemble all
the male hostages against the garden wall,
where we shot them."</p>

<p>Hundreds of witnesses called in one town,
after the Germans had passed on, show
that the German officers and soldiers were
engaged in one horrible orgy of pillage,
drunkenness, lust and murder. They began
by breaking open all wine cellars and soon
the officers went reeling and staggering
through the streets, firing their revolvers into
the windows of houses and stores. They
blasted the safes open with dynamite. They
carried goods from the shelves to the freight
trains, and as fast as the town was pillaged,
burned the houses. During four days they
looted and burned twelve hundred houses,
stores, factories, schools and churches. They
left lying on the ground seven hundred dead
bodies, chiefly women and children. Two
trains laden with the men and women who
were strong enough to work were carried off
to Germany. All the manufactories where
the artisan class were wont to work were
systematically destroyed. Marching away
from towns that were blazing furnaces, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
German soldiers drove in advance a long line
of women and children, with a few aged
men, and used them as screens behind which
they could march into the next town that
was to be looted.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Looting of Louvain</span></p>

<p>In justifying the use of the atrocity as a
military instrument more efficient in breaking
down the morale of the Belgian army
than cannon and liquid fire could possibly be,
a German army officer's letter uses these
words: "The ruthless use of severities upon
the civilians has now succeeded in scattering
the wretched Belgian army." But concerning
what atrocity is this officer writing? He
wrote these words at the end of the third
day, after the Germans had pillaged Louvain,
thus serving notice on all the Belgian and
French cities, rich in historic monuments,
libraries, galleries, cathedrals, and art treasures,
that unless they immediately surrendered,
their whole city would be ruined.</p>

<p>And ruined after what manner? Let Cardinal
Mercier, the Primate of Belgium, tell
the story. "At Louvain the third part of
the city has been destroyed; one thousand
and seventy-four dwellings have disappeared;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in addition, in the suburbs Kesselloo, Herent
and Herberle, one thousand, eight hundred
and twenty-eight houses have been burned.
In this dear city of Louvain, ever in my
thoughts, the magnificent church of St. Peter
will never recover its former splendour. The
ancient college of St. Ives, the art schools,
the commercial and consular schools of the
University; the old markets; our rich library,
with its collections, its unique and unpublished
manuscripts, its archives, its gallery of
great portraits of illustrious rectors, chancellors,
professors, dating from the time of its
foundation, which preserved for masters and
students alike a noble tradition, and were an
incitement to good work&mdash;all this accumulation
of intellectual, historic, and artistic richness,
the fruit of the labours of five centuries,
all, all is in ashes."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Breaking Down the Conscience
of Their Men</span></p>

<p>More terrible still the scheme invented by
the Kaiser and the War Staff for breaking
down the conscience of the German soldier.
The simple peasants of Bavaria, the artisans
of Saxony, until a generation ago, were
reared in the morals of Martin Luther. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
common consent Luther is one of the great
men of modern times. At a critical moment
in history he stood forth affirming Paul's
statement that every man must give an account
of himself unto God. Since Pope
Julius could not give his account unto God,
Martin Luther claimed religious liberty as to
creed and conduct for himself. Since no
kaiser could give his account unto God,
Martin Luther claimed the right of self-government,
through political democracy.
Since no philosopher could give his account,
Luther demanded liberty of thought and
speech. Carrying out this principle, when
three hundred years had passed, the free
nations stood forth clothed with political
democracy, educational democracy, religious
democracy, industrial democracy. Just as
we trace some river back to a spring on the
mountainside, so we trace these great institutions
of the Reformation back to Martin
Luther, who received his ideas from Paul
and John, from Huss and Savonarola, reinforced
by John Calvin and Erasmus.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Soldier's Token</span></p>

<p>But Luther's ethics were the ethics of
Moses. For several generations the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
peasants had been taught that it was criminal
to kill, steal, burn, rape and pillage.
They knew by heart the words of Jesus,
"Woe unto him who offends against one of
my little ones; it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and
that he were drowned in the depths of the
sea." Plainly the Ten Commandments stood
squarely in the pathway of the Kaiser's
ambition. Unless his ambitions for world
rule were to be defeated, some scheme had
to be invented to free the German soldier
from conscience, and break the fetters of
divine law.</p>

<p>Therefore the soldier's token was invented.
It comes under Jesus' special condemnation,
in that not only the Kaiser and the War
Staff pursued crime, but "taught men so."
These tokens are made of stiff cardboard or
of aluminum. At the top is a portrait of
Deity as the Kaiser conceives him to be; in
one hand the Kaiser's God holds a sickle, for
the death-harvest. Beneath, the Kaiser and
his War Staff wrote these words, "Strike
him dead; the Day of Judgment will not
ask you for reasons."</p>

<p>The soldier might read this: "You can
slay, pillage, loot, burn, rape, leave thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of bodies massacred and mutilated on the
ground, but remember that your Kaiser and
your War Staff will stand between you and
the avenging God, and will see to it that
the Judge of all the earth makes you no
trouble on the great day of accounting."
The Kaiser's God, however, is our Devil.
For three years the Kaiser has had the Devil
all mixed up with God,&mdash;being unable to
distinguish between them. Whenever the
Kaiser uses the word "Gott," Americans
always substitute the word "Devil." With
one change the soldier's token is quite accurate,&mdash;"Strike
them dead,&mdash;old men, girls
and children,&mdash;the Devil will not ask you
for reasons. Hell and damnation are fully
satisfied with all you Germans have done."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Eitel Anders</span></p>

<p>But when the German soldier boy took
this token out of his pocket, and looked at
his license to crime, what effect did it have
upon him? Here is the diary of Eitel
Anders. It is believed that he belonged to
the 14th Bavarian regiment. The diary was
taken from his body upon the battle-field,
and is similar to hundreds of others. "We
crossed the bridge over the Maas at 11:50<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in the morning. We then arrived at the
town of Waendre. When we went out of
the town, everything was in ruins. In one
house a whole collection of weapons was
found [the Mayor had ordered the women to
bring to his house every weapon that they
could find, that the Germans might have no
excuse for saying that any one had struck
their soldiers or fired a gun]. All the inhabitants,
without exception, were brought
out and shot. This shooting was heart-breaking,
as they all knelt down and prayed, but
praying is no ground for mercy. A few
shots rang out, and they fell back into the
green grass and slept forever. It is real
sport." But how did Eitel Anders sleep
that night? We know that Macbeth did
not sleep after he murdered Duncan and
Banquo. Did the Kaiser succeed in stultifying
conscience in Eitel Anders? The next
day the soldier made another entry;&mdash;mark
the opening words: "This morning, in happy
mood and high spirits, we passed through
Taturages. But before this we cleaned up
the suburb of Mons, and burned the houses.
The inhabitants came out of the houses into the
open plain. Here many heart-breaking scenes
occurred. It was really terrible to watch."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Plainly the soldier's token and the Kaiser's
scheme succeeded. Having stated that he
had murdered men, young Eitel Anders
sleeps well at night, and the "next morning
in happy mood and high spirits" wakened
to plan fresh crimes. Macbeth had no German
soldier's token to help him sleep at
night. Conscience became the whisper of
God in his soul. Sleep forsook his eyes,
and slumber his eyelids. Shakespeare's murderer
did not dare trust himself out under
the stars that blazed with anger, but Eitel
Anders' sleep was not disturbed by the blood
upon his hands, because he really believed
the Kaiser would be able to stand between
him and the Great Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>After General Clauss shot fifteen aged men
in the streets of Gerbéviller, too, that officer
rode away with a light heart, quite free
from the remorse that unseated the reason
of Macbeth. Plainly the Kaiser's scheme
succeeded. It destroyed conscience in many
German officers and soldiers alike. To-day,
the men of Germany without moral sense or
any remorse following their crimes are like
a sky that holds an empty socket where
once the summer-making sun had shined.
They are like human bodies out of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the intellect has passed, leaving only gibbering
idiots. The German "Laws of War
on Land," their Handbook of Military Tactics,
has organized crime into a science, and
killed in men the spiritual optic nerve. Germany
to-day is an intellectual machine, and
her officers and her soldiers at last can commit
crimes without remorse, which proves
that they are becoming moral idiots.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gerbéviller the Martyred</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In August of 1914, when the German
army was broken and compelled to retreat
before the French, they passed through
many French towns and villages in which
they found no soldiers and no weapons, and
where no battle, no skirmish and no shot
took place. During last July and August
we went slowly from one of these ruined
towns to another, talking with the broken-hearted
women and children, comparing the
photographs taken immediately after the
German retreat and almost before the mutilated
bodies were cold. Slowly we sifted
the evidence. On the ground we compared
the full official records made at the time,
with the statements of wretched survivors
who live in cellars, where once stood the
beautiful homes, the orchards and vineyards,
but where now all is desolation and anguish.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the multitude of events described
by witnesses who survived the martyrdom
of their village are the following: When
the noise of the approach of General Clauss'
division of twenty thousand soldiers in full
retreat was heard, an aged Frenchman stood
in his open door. He had retired from
business, to spend his last days midst the
friends of his childhood and youth. Hearing
the noise of the approaching army, the
merchant stepped to his open door. As the
first automobile swept by, the German officers
lifted their revolvers and emptied the
lead into the old man's body. He pitched
forward down the stone steps, and in his
death struggle worked his way to the wrought
iron gate, where after the German retreat he
was found dead. Before touching the body,
official photographers, under the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
their noble Prefect, took their photographs
from different angles. In the garden behind
the smoking cellar was found the wife, lying
dead upon the grass, her left wrist tied by
the clothes-line to the root of an apple tree,
the right wrist tied to a clump of gooseberry
bushes. She was dead, but not through dagger
or pistol. Standing beside their graves
we studied the photographs and talked with
the families of the fifteen aged men whom
General Clauss ordered shot because there
were no young or middle-aged men in the
village whom he could kill.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Burning of an Ambulance Driver</span></p>

<p>Most harrowing the testimony given by
the mother of a Red Cross ambulance
driver. The day before the Germans came,
this man had returned from the front, bringing
an ambulance filled with wounded soldiers.
While the division of twenty thousand
Germans were looting the houses, and
carrying away every rug, carpet, table, chair,
picture, tool, art treasure towards the Rhine,
German officers entered the house of Sister
Juliet, who was nursing the wounded soldiers.
Finding the young Red Cross man
there, they immediately shot him. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
while his mother was holding his head in
her arms and staunching his wounds, a German
officer approached and, seizing her
hands, held them behind her back, while
one of the privates poured petrol over her
son's head. With two fingers this soldier
ripped the clothes from the breast of the
wounded man and poured oil under his shirt
and then set fire to his garments. Referring
to his death struggles and the photograph
of the charred mass that had once been her
son lying on the brick pavement, this mother
exclaimed, "If I had only let him bleed to
death! If I had only let him bleed to death!
Then they could not have made him die
twice!"</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Murder of Hereminel</span></p>

<p>In a little farming village not many miles
from Gerbéviller the martyred, stands a
battered square belfry, into which the Germans
lifted their machine guns, hoping to
hold back the pursuit of the French army,
thus giving General Clauss time to retreat
and "dig in" some miles to the northeast.
Tying the ropes to the axle of automobile
trucks, the Germans soon lifted their guns
into the church tower. They then drove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
French women and children into the church
and used them as a screen, for no German
ever exposes himself to danger if he can
possibly find a woman or child behind whom
he can hide. One young mother did not
immediately obey, because of certain duties
in connection with her little child. With
two other girls this young wife was stood up
against the stone wall of her own little house
and shot, for the purpose of teaching French
women to obey instantly when German savages
command.</p>

<p>When all the women and children were
packed into the church, a boy was sent back
to tell the French that if they fired upon the
guns in the church belfry, they would kill
their own families. Two nights later when
a storm was raging, the women slipped a
little boy through the window, and sent
word to the officers of the approaching
French army that their wives wished them
to open fire on the German guns. In blowing
these weapons out of the belfry, the
French killed twenty of their own wives
and children, who preferred to share death
with the men they loved, rather than suffer
nameless indignities from German brutes.
In a hundred years of history where shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
you find a record of soldiers, whether red,
black or yellow, save Germans, who were
such sneaking, snivelling cowards that they
do not dare play the game fairly and like
men, but in their chattering terror use
women and little children as shields against
danger? Of a truth, the "Potsdam gang"
has added a new word to the literature of
cowardice.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Frenchman's Love of France</span></p>

<p>Terrible also the German assassination of
the land itself. All men love their native
land, but the Frenchman's love has a unique
quality. He speaks of La Belle France as
Dante spoke of Beatrice, as Petrarch spoke
of Laura, and the name of France lingers
upon his lips as music trembles in the air
after the song is sung.</p>

<p>It is love of native land that has made
France beautiful just as through affection
the lark, after completing its nest, makes it
soft and warm by pulling the down out of
her own bosom. The French people love
France as Millais loved his Gleaners, as
Bellini loved the missal he had illuminated,
and as that young architect loved the little
Roslyn chapel, upon whose delicate capitals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he had lavished his very soul. For centuries
the enemies of farms, houses, towns and cities
have been fire, flood and earthquake. Witness
the city of St. Pierre. An interior explosion
blew off the cap of the mountain and
a flood of gas poured down upon the lovely
city, asphyxiated the citizens and left not
one house standing. Witness that mighty
convulsion in San Francisco that brought
thousands of brick buildings crashing down
in ruins. Witness the fire in Chicago that
turned the great city into piles of twisted
iron and ashes. In New Zealand there is
a lake called Avernus, the birdless lake.
Poisonous gases rise from the black flood of
water, and soon the lark with its song, and
the eagle with its flight fall into the poisonous
flood.</p>

<p>But all these images are quite inadequate
to explain the devastation of France upon
the retreat of the Germans. About forty
miles north of Paris, one strikes the ruined
region. Then hour after hour passes, while
with slow movement and breaking heart the
investigator journeys one hundred miles to
the north and zigzags one hundred and
twenty-five miles south again, through that
ruined region. Centuries ago Julius Cæsar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
described it as a wild land, rough, with
forests filled with wolves. Then the
Frenchman entered the scene. He subdued
all the wild grasses, drained the valleys and
widened the streams into canals. He enriched
the fields, surrounded the meadows
with odorous hedges and filled swamps with
perfumed shrubs. Slowly the Frenchman
threw arches of stone across the streams and
carved the bridges until they were rich in
art, while everything made for use was
carried up to beauty. He gave to the roof
of the barn its lovely lines; the approach to
the house was upon a curved road, the highways
were shaded by two rows of noble trees.
The stony hillside was terraced, and there
the vines grew purple in the sun. How
simple was his life! What a sanctuary his
little home! With what rich embroidery of
wheat he covered all the hills! He was
prudent without being stingy, thrifty without
being mean. The French peasant saves
against old age with one hand and distributes
to his children with the other.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">What Hate Can Do</span></p>

<p>And having lavished all their love upon
the little farmhouse, the granary and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
garden, having pruned these grape-vines with
their clusters of white and purple, the time
came when each vine seemed like a friend,
dear as that miraculous picture was to
Baucis and Philemon. For these reasons
all France was invested with affection and
beauty.</p>

<p>The French peasants loved their land and
then lost it. One morning the Hun stood at
the gate. The farmers with their pruning
knives were no match for Germans with
their machine guns, and down they fell under
the plum trees they were pruning. The
devastated regions of France are like unto a
world ruined by devils. The Germans cut
down the apples, the pears, and all the
peaches. They did not spare the cherry, the
quince, the gooseberry and currant, or the
vineyards. Gone also all the beautiful
bridges&mdash;they have been dynamited! Gone
all the lovely and majestic Thirteenth Century
churches! Gone all the galleries, for
some of the finest art treasures in the world
have perished.</p>

<p>The land has been put back to where it
was when Julius Cæsar described it two
thousand years ago&mdash;a wild land, and waste,
growing up with thorns and thistles. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
proclamation on a wall tells the whole story.
"Let no building stand, no vine or tree.
Before retreating see that the wells and
springs are plentifully polluted with corpses
and with creasote." The spirit was this,
"Since we Germans cannot have this land,
no one else shall."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Prince Eitel's Crime</span></p>

<p>But there is more. One of the historic
chateaux is that of Avricourt, rich in noble
associations of history. It was one of the
class of buildings covered by a clause in the
international agreements between Germany,
France and the United States and all the
civilized nations, safeguarding historic buildings.
For many months it was the home of
Prince Eitel, the Kaiser's second son.</p>

<p>When a judge and jury held inquiry at
the ruins of the chateau, the aged French
servant, who understood the electric lighting
and had charge of the gas plant during
Eitel's occupancy, stated that he heard the
German officers telling Eitel Frederick that
he would disgrace the German name if he
destroyed a building that had no relation to
war, that could be of no aid or comfort to
the French army, and that he would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his own name, and that of his family, a name
of shame and contempt, of obloquy and
scorn. But the man would not yield. He
brought in his auto trucks and carried to the
freight cars every historic object in the
splendid chateau. Having pledged himself
to leave the building uninjured, the prince
stopped his car at the gates of the exit, ran
back to this historic house, filled his firebrand,
spread the flames upon the halls,
waited until the flames were well in progress,
and then ordered his men to light the fuse of
dynamite bombs. A few days later inquiry
was held and testimony of aged servants
and little children was taken. The degeneracy
of this German Prince as then revealed
has not been equalled since the first chapter
of Romans catalogued the unnatural crimes
of the men of the ancient world. Germany
has no artistic sense. Her own poet, Heine,
predicts that she will yet pull in pieces her
one fine cathedral. The German poet does
not think any beautiful thing is safe so long
as it is in German hands. This gifted Hebrew
had the vision that literally saw the German
pounding to pieces the Cathedral at Louvain
and Ypres, in Arras, in Bapaume, in St.
Quentin, and Rheims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Rheims Cathedral</span></p>

<p>One of the atrocities that has horrified the
civilized world has been the ruin of Rheims
Cathedral. Germany, of course, was denied
by nature any gift of imagination. The
German mind is a hearty, mediocre mind,
that can multiply and exploit the inventions
and discoveries of the other races. The
Germans contributed practically nothing to
the invention of the locomotive, the steamboat,
the Marconigram, the automobile, the
airplane, the phonograph, the sewing machine,
the reaper, the electric light. Even as
to the weapons with which she fights, Americans
invented for Germany her revolver, her
machine gun, her turreted ship, and her submarine.
In retrospect it seems absolutely
incredible that Germany could have been so
helplessly and hopelessly unequal to the invention
of the tools that have made her rich.</p>

<p>But imagination is not her gift. If Sheffield
can give her a model knife, Germany
can reproduce that knife in quantities and
undersell Sheffield. The German people keep
step in a regiment, in a factory and on a
ship, and therefore are wholesalers. The
French mind is creative. It stands for individual
excellence, and is at the other extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from the German temperament. The emblem
of the German intellect is beer; the emblem
of the English intellect is port wine; the
emblem of the French mind is champagne;
the emblem of an American intellect like
Emerson's is a beaker filled with sunshine&mdash;but
Germany has a "beer" mind. It is this
lack of imagination that explains Nietzsche's
statement that for two hundred years Germany
has been "the enemy of culture" while
Heinrich Heine insists that "the very name
of culture is France."</p>

<p>It is this total lack of any appreciation of
art and architecture that explains Germany's
destruction of some of the noblest buildings
of the world. She cannot by any chance
conceive how the other races look upon her
vandalism. Her own foreign secretary expressed
it publicly in one of her state papers,
"Let the neutrals cease chattering about
cathedrals. Germany does not care one straw
if all the galleries and churches in the world
were destroyed, providing we gain our military
ends." Guizot in his history of civilization
presents three tests of a civilized people:
First, they revere their pledges and
honour; second, they reverence and pursue
the beautiful in painting, architecture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
literature; third, they exhibit sympathy in
reform towards the poor, the weak and the
unfortunate.</p>

<p>Now apply those tests to the Kaiser and
his War Staff, and you understand why
Rheims Cathedral is a ruin.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> No building
since the Parthenon was more precious to
the world's culture. What majesty and dignity
in the lines! What a wealth of statuary!
How wonderful the Twelfth Century
glass! With what lightness did these arches
leap into the air! Now, the great bombs
have torn holes through the roof; only little
bits of glass remain; broken are the arches,
ruined these flying buttresses, the altar where
Jeanne d'Arc stood at the crowning of Charles
is quite gone. The great library, the bishop's
palace, all the art treasures are in ruins.
But ancient and noble buildings do not belong
to a race, they belong to the world.
Sacred forever the threshold of the Parthenon,
once pressed by the feet of Socrates
and Plato! Thrice sacred that aisle of Santa
Croce in Florence, dear to Dante and Savonarola.
To be treasured forever the solemn
beauty of Westminster Abbey, holding the
dust of men of supreme genius.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>In front of the wreck of the Cathedral
of Rheims, all blackened with German fire,
broken with the German hammer, is the
statue of Jeanne d'Arc. There she stands,
immortal forever, guiding the steed of the
sun with the left hand, lifting the banners
of peace and liberty with the right. By
some strange chance, no bomb injured that
bronze. That figure seems a beautiful prophecy
of a day when the spirit of liberty, riding
in a chariot of the sun, shall guide a greater
host made up of all the peoples who revere
the treasures of art and architecture, and
law and liberty, and will ride on to a victory
that will be the sublimest conquest in the
annals of time.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Devastation of the French
Home</span></p>

<p>But the ruin of his cathedrals, his galleries,
his schoolhouses, his libraries, his
farmhouses, his vineyards and orchards, is
the least of sorrows of the Frenchman. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a little village near Ham dwelt a man who
had saved a fortune for his old age, 100,000
francs. When the invading army, like a
black wave, was approaching, he buried his
treasure beneath the large, flat stones that
made the walk from the road up to the
front step of his house. Then, with the
other villagers, the old man fled. Many
months passed by, while the Germans bombarded
the village. At last the German
wave retreated, and once more the old man
drew near to his little village. There was
nothing, nothing left. After a long time,
he located the street, which was on the very
edge of the town, but could not find the
cellar of his own house. Great shells had
fallen. Exploding in the cellar, they had
blown the bricks away. Then other shells
had fallen hard by and blown dirt that filled
up what once had been a cellar. The very
trees in front of his house had been blown
away and replaced by shell pits. In one of
his reports Ambassador Sharp states that
the aged man had up to that time failed to
locate his house, much less his buried treasure.
But what trifles light as air are
houses in contrast with other forms of
desolation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruined Homes and Hopes</span></p>

<p>At the officers' headquarters, one night
after returning from the front, several officers
were recounting to us their dramatic
experiences. Many harrowing tales were
told. During the winter of 1915, in the
trenches at the foot of Vimy Ridge, several
English officers and a French captain were
down in a safety cellar having their pipes
together and recounting the events of the
day. Rain was falling and they delayed
their stay. Finally the moment came to
return to their trenches above. At that
moment an English sentinel exclaimed:
"One week from to-day and I will be home
in England with my wife and baby. One
more week! The next seven days seem to
me like seven eternities." The English captain
congratulated the boy, saying, "In two
months my permission will come and I will
have eight days home with my family."
Then the English officer noticed the French
officer's agitation. Turning to him, the
English captain exclaimed, "And when do
you go, Captain?" "When do I go home,"
exclaimed the Frenchman bitterly, "when
do I go home? You Englishmen do not
understand! Your land has never been invaded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Go home! To what could I go?
The Germans have been in my land for a
year. My little town is gone, quite gone.
My little house is gone, and gone my little
shop! My wife is still a young woman!
My little girl,&mdash;she is just a little, little girl!
Why, I never thought of her as a woman!
And now our priest writes me that my
young wife and my little girl will have
babes in two months by these brutes!" And
then the storm broke. The Frenchman beat
his head upon the rude table, while the two
Englishmen fled into the rain and night,
knowing that the rain was nothing against
those tears of pain, for that man's hopes
were dead forever. That lieutenant's only
task was to recover France and then transfer
all his ambitions to God in Heaven.</p>

<p>Such devastations of the soul are why
there must be no inconclusive peace. Unconditional
surrender is the only word.
Whether this war goes on one year or five
years it must go on until the Hun repents
and makes restitution&mdash;so far as possible.
Alas, a myriad of these German outrages
are irremediable! Thoughtful men doubt
whether the German will ever learn the
wickedness of his own atrocities and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
crimes of militarism until his own land is
laid waste, until he sees the horrors of war
with his own eyes, and hears the groans of
his own people with his own ears, sees his
own land laid desolate, finds his own heart
crushed under anguish. Yet retribution in
kind would be unthinkable for the Allies!</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Foul Crime Against Women</span></p>

<p>Many Americans have looked with horror
upon the photograph of the mutilated bodies
of women. Sacred forever the bosom of his
mother, and not less sacred the body of every
woman. Not content with mutilating the
bodies of Allied officers, of Belgian boys,
they lifted the knife upon the loveliness of
woman. The explanation was first given by
the Germans themselves. When the Hun
joins the army, he must pass his medical examination.
A few drops of blood are taken
from the left arm, and the Wassermann
blood culture is developed. If free from
disease, the soldier receives a card giving
him access to the camp women, who are kept
in the rear for the convenience of the German
soldier. If, however, the Wassermann
test shows that the German has syphilis, the
soldier bids him report to the commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
officer. The captain tells him plainly that
he must stay away from the camp women
upon peril of his life, and that if he uses one
of their girls he will be shot like a dog. Having
syphilis himself, the German will hand
it on to the camp girl, and she in turn will
contaminate all the other soldiers, and that
means that the Kaiser would soon have no
army. Therefore, the soldier that has this
foul disease must stay away from the camp
women on peril of his life. Under this restriction
the syphilitic soldier has but one
chance, namely, to capture a Belgian or
French girl; but using this girl means contaminating
her, and she in turn will contaminate
the next German using her. To
save his own life, therefore, when the syphilitic
German has used a French or Belgian
girl, he cuts off her breast as a warning to
the next German soldier. The girl's life
weighs less than nothing against lust or the
possibility of losing his life by being charged
with the contamination of his brother German.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Insane Through Pain and Grief</span></p>

<p>One pathetic and dramatic story ran up
and down the trenches upon a line twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
miles in length. Told by different soldiers,
that tragic story never varies in the essential
facts. When the Germans ruined a
village near Ham, they carried away some
fifty-four girls and women between the ages
of fourteen and forty. These girls were
held behind the lines among the camp
women, kept for the Huns. One chilly
morning last April a French boy, lying on a
board on the bottom of his trench, heard
the wild shrieks of a girl. Standing on tiptoe
he peeped over the top to find the French
soldiers in the one trench and the Boches in
the other had forgotten the peril of the
sniper's bullet, and were staring at a young
girl out in No Man's Land. One week of
cruelty had driven the girl insane. The
German soldiers had lifted her out of their
trench, and with their bayonets had pushed
her in the direction of the French lines, and
were shouting to her to go over to her
friends among the French.</p>

<p>What the French soldiers saw was a
young woman, clothed in a dark blue skirt,
her waist torn, her bosom exposed, her hair
loose upon her shoulders. She was standing
bewildered in No Man's Land. Now she
poured forth the pealing laughter of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
maniac, and now she seemed to be talking
to herself. Suddenly her eye caught sight
of a human body, wearing the garb of a
French soldier. The girl did not know that
it was a French boy who in the darkness
had been cutting the barbed wire, and in the
midst of the German flare had been caught by
a bullet. Mistaking the dead boy for that
of her young husband, the girl ran forward,
fell upon her knees, and lifted the body that
was already cold into her arms. From time
to time she would take an arm grown stiff
and try to put it around her neck and then
gaze upon it, not understanding why the
cold hands did not clasp her around in the
dear accustomed way. Suddenly her eyes
saw his coat, lying near by; but she did not
know that the boy in his death struggles
had torn that coat from his body. She
thought that garment, already stiff with
blood, was her own little babe. Picking up
the coat, she dropped upon her knees, lifted
it to her breast, and began to sway to and
fro, and soon the French soldiers heard a
lullaby, familiar and dear to every Frenchman
whose mother with that song charmed
the fear out of the eyes and the terror from
the heart. So terrible was the scene that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for the moment the Frenchman and German
alike forgot all warfare! Finally, a German
lifted his rifle to the shoulder, and as the girl,
rising to her feet, flung the bloody coat
away, and screamed, "The Boche! the
Boche!" his rifle cracked, and the young
woman sank slowly down. A moment
later, all helmets, German and French alike,
disappeared behind the trenches. Silence
rested on No Man's Land, and events went
on as before. But for France the world will
never be the same again. German crimes
have lighted a flame of sacred anger that
will never burn out until German cruelty
has been utterly consumed. That is why
the fire sparkles in the eyes of the Allied
soldiers whenever you suggest peace by
negotiation, or a peace without victory.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Wounded German Colonel</span></p>

<p>Last winter, a German colonel was shot
through the spinal cord. His lower limbs
were completely paralyzed, and the paralysis
began to extend to his hands. The
wounded man developed the theory that if
he could only be carried back to Germany
recovery was possible. Lifted into an ambulance,
he was carried twelve miles to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
northeast, towards the Rhine. Unable to
endure the agony of the rough road, he
commanded the ambulance driver to stop
in front of the priest's house, near &mdash;&mdash;.
Two aged French women cared for the
wounded man during January, February and
March. Little by little the wings of the
angel of death fanned away the mist before
the eyes of the German officer. For two
and a half years he had carried an aluminum
token with a portrait of the German Kaiser's
conception of God, and the words, "Strike
them all dead. The Day of Judgment will
not ask you for reasons." But at last a moment
had come when he lost confidence in
the pledge of the Kaiser and the War Staff
to stand between him and an outraged God.
One morning a little French boy waited
after mass to tell the priest that the German
officer wanted him to come at once. The
important message proved to be a warning
that the von Hindenburg line was nearly
completed, that the orders for retreat had
gone out, that every church, bank, factory,
house, was to be looted and then burned, and
the whole region turned into a desolation.
"These two aged women and you yourself
have been very kind to me, and this pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
will take you through the German lines to
a place of safety." And then the dying
officer advised the priest to take the two
women and go away at once. The news
utterly crushed the kindly man of God.
Touched by the grief of the white-haired
priest, and perhaps terrified by memory and
remorse, words of righteous wrath and repentance
fell from the lips of the officer.
These were his last words, as that old priest
transcribed them from the lips of this dying
German. "Curses upon our army! Curses
upon our Kaiser, and our War Staff! Ten
thousand curses upon the Fatherland!
Either God is dead or Germany is doomed!"
Going out of the door, the last words the
aged priest heard were the dying curses of
an officer, whose soul had been debauched
by his Kaiser and his War Staff, and who
upon the brink of the Day of Judgment
realized that for every crime he must give an
account unto God. "Woe unto him who
offends one of my little ones; it were better
for him that a millstone were hanged about
his neck and that he were drowned in the
depths of the sea."</p>

<p>That conscience-smitten dying German
packed the genius of the moral universe into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the curse he pronounced upon the Kaiser, the
War Staff and the Fatherland. When the
veil was taken away from his eyes he saw
that the stars in their courses were fighting
against the Kaiser. In the awful hour of
death he learned at last that God is not
dead, but that because of her atrocities, Germany
is doomed.</p>

<div class="center"><big>II<br />
The Pan-German Empire Scheme,
For Which Germany Lost
Her Soul</big>
</div>

<p>German apostasy began with German
military success. What the Kaiser
offered to Germany in exchange for her soul
was the Pan-German empire. The originator
of the world empire scheme was the
Kaiser; Nietzsche was its philosopher;
Treitsche its historian; Bernhardi its advocate;
and von Hindenburg its executive.
The first conference regarding the Pan-German
empire seems to have been called in
1895, and was held in the Potsdam Palace.
During the next two or three years, a world
organization was brought together by the
"Potsdam gang," with the Kaiser at the
center, an inner circle of officers, and politicians,
a larger circle of bankers, manufacturers,
and ship owners. Finally there was
a far-flung web of diplomats, spies, commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
travellers, Pan-German League agents,
organizing in New York, Chicago and San
Francisco, in Buenos Ayres and Rio de Janeiro,
in Buda Pesth and Vienna, in Constantinople
and Cairo, German Veteran Leagues,
German Commercial Associations, all looking
towards the day when the Kaiser would
be the world emperor, and all countries
would become provinces paying tribute to
the world capital, Berlin. "What about
international law?" asked an American diplomat
of Bernhardi. "There will be no international
law," was the answer. "Berlin
will decide what laws are best for the rest
of the world."</p>

<p>The Pan-German empire pamphlets, maps,
books, magazine articles, published during
the next ten years, were legion, but Professor
Tannemann, a personal friend of the
Kaiser, in 1911 restated the Kaiser's scheme.
The essence of Pan-German plan was condensed
into a few sentences: "From Hamburg
and the North Sea to the Persian
Gulf; the immediate goal, by 1915, the conquest
of 250,000,000 of people; the ultimate
goal, the Germanization of all the nations of
the world." One of the Kaiser's speeches
contains the explanation of his dream of becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a world conqueror: "From my childhood
I have been under the influence of five
men,&mdash;Alexander, Julius Cæsar, Theodoric
II, Frederick the Great and Napoleon. Each
of these men dreamed a dream of a world
empire; they failed. I am dreaming a
dream of a German world empire&mdash;and my
mailed fist shall succeed." The Kaiser
printed a map headed, "The Roman Empire;
Cæsar Augustus, world emperor."
That map shows the once great states,
Athens, Ephesus, Jerusalem, Alexandria,
Carthage, reduced to county seat towns,
paying tribute to the world capital, while
their captive kings had walked as slaves in
the triumphal processions along the Appian
Way, towards the palace of the world ruler,
Cæsar Augustus. One of the Pan-German
empire pamphlets, and many of the German
newspapers contain a revised map of Europe,
showing "Germania" stamped across the
continent, with St. Petersburg, Paris and
London become county seat towns, paying
tribute to the world capital, Berlin. Many
German newspapers, during this war, have
published maps showing Canada as a German
province, with the name "Germania"
stamped across South America, Mexico and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Central America. These many pamphlets
and Pan-German empire books explain Admiral
Dewey's report to President McKinley.
That report seems to have been written
in the cabin of the flag-ship <i>Olympia</i>, in
Manila Bay. Dewey states that the German
admiral told him plainly to make a
note of this prophecy that within fifteen
years (1899, report of Admiral Dewey), Germany
would crush France and Belgium, seize
Holland and Denmark, utterly destroy England,
and take Canada as a German province.
Admiral Dewey added that the German admiral
told him that while the Kaiser intended
to seize New York and Washington and hold
them for an indemnity, he did not intend to
permanently hold in subjection the United
States, but he did intend to retain Mexico
and South America, and then "dispose of
the Monroe Doctrine as he thinks best."
This may explain the Kaiser's word to Mr.
Gerard: "After this war I will stand no nonsense
from the United States." So astounding
were these claims that the statesmen
and rulers of the world laughed at these
threats, deeming it incredible that Germany
was plotting a world war. Two or three
men of remarkable prescience and vision,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
General Roberts in London, Chéradame in
Paris, and Ex-President Roosevelt, understood
and therefore never ceased warning
the nation to prepare and make ready for a
conflict that seemed to them inevitable.</p>

<p>When the Kaiser first announced his Pan-German
empire scheme he bribed his people
by appeals to avarice, ambition, and jealousy
of England and Russia. The arguments
used by the Potsdam gang were very
simple: Agriculture pays six per cent., trade
eight per cent., finance ten per cent., shipping
twelve per cent., but war is an industry
that pays fifty per cent. dividend
upon the investment. Germany's war upon
little Denmark, a people without army or
navy, paid an enormous dividend upon the
investment, in that it gave Germany one of
her richest provinces, made possible the Kiel
Canal, and left Denmark permanently crippled
and exposed. "Denmark and Holland,
also, are apples," says a German author,
"that are slowly ripening, and we will pick
the fruit at the proper time." Germany's
war of 1864 upon Austria was the attack of
a brigand upon a traveller rich with gold, and
the cities and provinces that Germany wrested
away from the ruler of Vienna paid a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
per cent. upon the investment. In his
Memoirs Bismarck tells the world plainly that
he deliberately fomented a war with France,
that he might seize the iron ore provinces of
Alsace and Lorraine, in order to obtain the
hematite iron that would make it possible
for Germany to pass from the agricultural
people into an industrial and manufacturing
state as the competitor of England for the
world's trade. For more than forty years
the chief argument presented in the Reichstag
for increased appropriations for the army
and the navy was the money dividends paid
by war.</p>

<p>In 1911 the Kaiser spread out before his
people bribes most alluring. Just as the
Devil led Jesus up into a mountain and
showed Him the whole earth, so the Kaiser
and the Potsdam gang led the Germans into
a mount of temptation and showed them
how easy it was to make the Kaiser a world
emperor. The argument was very simple;
after twenty-five years of preparation, Germany
has nine million soldiers, has cannons,
liquid fire, poisoned gases, battle-ships, aeroplanes,
with every wagon and automobile
ready to have the pleasure body removed,
and a military body substituted. "We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ready to the last buckle on the horses' harness."
To the east was Russia, broken by
war with Japan; Russia with her gold mines,
her wheat granaries, her vast coal and iron
deposits and forests all undeveloped. To
the southeast was Rumania, with her oil
wells, with Constantinople and the silk fields,
and the Tigris, the gateway to the Indian
Ocean, and the treasures of the Bagdad railway
country. To the west was unarmed
Belgium, rich with twenty billions of treasure;
France, half armed, with her newly discovered
iron mines and coal measures; England,
one vast jewel box, a kind of Aladdin's
cave,&mdash;"Wait until Germany lifts her mailed
fists upon the English treasure box, there
will be enough for everybody in Berlin," is
the gist of Zimmermann's speech of November,
1914. "The people of the United States
call us Huns," writes the editor of the <i>Localanzeiger</i>,
"but New York had better remember
that the young Huns from the German forests
took only two weeks to cross the Alps and
loot the city of Rome." Other German
members of the Reichstag have likened the
United States unto a Cr&oelig;sus, the richest
man in the world, living in a golden house,
surrounded with bags, bursting with gems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and wedges of gold and silver, but a Cr&oelig;sus
that had no lock on his door and no weapon
in his hand.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Treasure Boxes of Europe</span></p>

<p>"Belgium is a lamb, France and England
are flocks of sheep, feeding and fattening in
the pasture, ready for our shears." All
these statements were sent out through Germany.
The other nations are so many treasure
boxes, ready for our military key to unlock
them. Boys, farmers' sons, discussed the
coming looting expedition in the hayfields.
College boys talked about the treasures of
England and France, Belgium and Holland,
as boys once talked about emptying the newly
discovered gold mines of California. Officers
drank to "The Day." Editors added fuel to
the flames of avarice. The statesmen cried,
"It is our duty to rule these countries, and
besides, by war we get great gain."</p>

<p>The influence of these incitements to avarice
and ambition is found in the letters taken
from the dead bodies of German soldiers.
In one letter, found near Vitrimont, the
German lover tells his sweetheart that he
expects soon to be in Paris, and will bring
her a handful of diamond rings, and a pocket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
full of bracelets and a few Paris gowns.
Another German boy writes his young wife
about a little valley in France with rich
pastures and meadows, and beautiful farmhouses,
and how Heinrich, Hans and Diedrich
had decided to pick out the four best
farms on which they would live as soon as
they had cleaned up Paris. He adds, however,
that Hans thinks it would be much
better for them to wait until England is
smashed, and when Canada is a colony, they
can pick farms there two or three miles
square, and make their children great landowners.
For this war was to pay Germany
a thousand per cent. dividend on her investment.</p>

<p>And who, even already, can deny that in
large part Germany has made good the
bribes offered to German boys? When one
thinks how Germany has looted the states
of Europe of her gold and silver, her bonds
and stocks, their pictures, books, furniture,
laces, silks, wheat, corn, wine, it is easy to
understand the Kaiser's statement that "war
should be Germany's chief national industry."
With the Kaiser crime has prospered.</p>

<p>Germany wanted this war, planned this
war, prepared for this war, and made treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
houses in which she could store the loot
of this war. Blood went to Germany's head
like drugged wine. For years she has been
beside herself with military success. The
Kaiser for twenty years has been rattling
his sword and bullying the nations. Standing
in the market-place, like some huge
Goliath, in the spirit of the common braggart
he has shouted, "I can lick anybody in the
world." In the nature of the case, one
brigand with his revolver is equal to a hundred
business men and manufacturers in a
railroad car. In the nature of the case also,
Germany, with her military preparedness,
should have been equal to a score of countries
like Belgium and France and Great
Britain and the United States&mdash;industrious,
hard-working, but unmilitary, peacefully
disposed. The deadly virus of avarice and
militarism has burned like a fever in Germany's
soul, even as avarice burned in the
soul of Judas Iscariot, and made him a
traitor that crucified not Belgium, but Jesus
upon the cross.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The German People and the Kaiser</span></p>

<p>Little by little under the influence of
this Pan-German empire scheme, the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
people began to go to pieces morally.
The breakdown of character is slow. The
most virulent disease needs time to destroy
the tissues, and poison the blood. The
first to go over to the Potsdam gang
were the officers and the army. Next followed
the university professors, the bankers
and the landowners. Last of all came
the manufacturers and the shippers, who for
a long time were timid lest their foreign
trade be injured. Finally the state clergy,
who received their salary from the Kaiser's
treasury, were whipped into line, and men
like Eucken, Harnack, heard the crack of
the slave-driver's scourge above their heads,
and became abject servants.</p>

<p>At last the woven web was spread all
over the world through spies. Could any
man have been lifted up above Berlin, and
had full power to survey the whole world,
he would have seen a spider's web, with its
center in Berlin, with the Kaiser as the big
black spider, sending out along the sinuous
threads into every capital of every country
and of every continent his evil plans and
plots. Men like von Bernstorff in Washington,
and Münsterberg in Boston, von Bopp,
recently convicted in San Francisco, Luxburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in Buenos Ayres, with their schemes to blow
up munition factories, planting of bombshells
in ships, dynamiting Parliament buildings,
blowing up bridges, organizing sedition in
Mexico, India, and Brazil, the millions and
millions of dollars spent in our own country,
the secret decorations of medals given to
bankers, manufacturers, shippers, editors,
newspaper boys, stenographers, make up a
story of Machiavellian deviltry and subtle
cunning that has no parallel. The only difference
between Judas and the average German
spy is that the modern spy in the
United States would not only have betrayed
Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, but would
have given ten per cent. off for cash. All
that Germany won in three hundred years
through the teachings of Martin Luther has
been lost in twenty-five years through the
influence of the Kaiser and his militarists.
In the presence of all the world we have
seen Germany lose her soul. All that John
Milton taught, as to the fall of Satan as an
angel, becoming a devil, has been literally
enacted on the stage before the nations of
the earth. What in 1900 was efficiency, in
1914 became the science of lying, theft, rape,
poison and assassination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Germany Constructs a Philosophy
to Justify Herself</span></p>

<p>Having entered upon war as her chief
national industry, and looking with greedy
eyes upon the steel plants, the looms and
factories of rich Belgium; envying France
her unique supremacy as the leader of the
fine arts; tempted by the little states like
Holland and Denmark on the west and
Rumania and Poland on the east, states that
seemed like purple clusters, bursting with
wine for German lips, it became necessary
for Germany to find a philosophy that would
break down the great convictions of morality
inherited from Martin Luther.</p>

<p>All wise men trace deeds back to the
thinking of the doer, just as they trace bitter
water back to a poisoned spring. Of
the German teaching of Prussianism we can
only say, no grapes from Prussian thorns,
no figs from Prussian thistles. What the
Prussians thought in their hearts, that they
became in their lives. What began as sparks
of avarice and ambition has ended in this
world conflagration, and Germany is responsible,
not for the sparks, but for the
world ruin. Alcibiades and Catiline and
Benedict Arnold all thought in terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
selfishness, and they all did cruel deeds.
The murder of Edith Cavell and Captain
Fryatt, the sinking of women and children
on steamers, the rape of Belgium and Northern
France, the assassination of Poland, the
deliberate, cold-blooded plots by the German
officers with the Turkish soldiers to exterminate
the Armenians, so that they could
settle on the lands, are the outer exhibition
in deeds of the inner philosophy of the Germans.
That is why their favorite philosopher
Nietzsche says that Germany's gift is
brute force and not intellect. ("Ecce Homo,"
page 38, and page 134: "Wherever Germany
extends her sway, she ruins culture. I feel it
my duty to tell the Germans that every crime
against culture lies on their conscience.")</p>

<p>A philosophy therefore was concocted,
called "Prussianism." This philosophy is
no secret, for Germany has trumpeted it
forth, from the top of the palace in Potsdam
and the Dom in Berlin. For fifteen years
it has been the very essence of the teaching
in her universities, her pulpit, her press and
her Parliament. This is its substance: Over
against Martin Luther's conception of God
as the All-wise and Good Father, who is
righteous Himself, and demands righteousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of His children, the new philosophy sets
up the political State as the be-all and end-all
for the German people. Omnipotence means
a Kaiser's arm, with that of a war staff,
carried up to the nth degree of power by
seventy millions of other arms.</p>

<p>"Weakness is the only sin against the
Holy Ghost," cries Bernhardi. Let the individual
German soldier be strong enough
to trample under foot the Belgian or French
merchant or girl. Let the German navy be
strong enough to sink every <i>Lusitania</i> or
<i>Sussex</i>. Let the German army be equal to
overrunning, looting, pillaging and dynamiting
France and Belgium. To be beaten
is to be contemptible, and therefore to be
sinful. Whatever wins the victory on land or
sea is right. The moment Germany crosses
the frontiers all Belgians and Frenchmen lose
any right whatever to either their lives or
their property, but from that moment the
invader's life and effects become sacred.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Reflex Influence of the Pan-German
Scheme Upon Germany's
Statesmen</span></p>

<p>Most disastrous and disorganizing the reflex
influence of Germany's philosophy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Prussianism, and her plot for a Pan-German
empire upon Germany's statesmen and diplomats.
From Phocion to Lincoln high-minded
statesmen have been jealous of their
pledges and of their treaties with other
countries. In one of his noblest orations
Edmund Burke speaks of "the peculiar sanctity
attaching to an international treaty."
Our own Washington spoke about the importance
of consideration and long deliberation
before an ambassador gave his word that,
once it is given, must stand "like the law of
God." Business men scoff at the trickster,
who plays fast and loose with his written
word given to the bank or to his creditors.
Nor is there a tribe of Indians that, once
they have eaten salt, or exchanged the pipe
of peace, but considers the pledge precious
as life itself. All civilized nations, therefore,
have been horrified at the way Germany has
broken down on the side of truthfulness,
until it is a proverb in the world to-day that
a thing is as worthless as a written pledge
by Germany.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Scrap of Paper</span></p>

<p>Our scholars have long known that Frederick
the Great was the first German to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that international treaties were to be observed
so long as they were useful and served his
purpose, and when that time passed a treaty
was to be counted "a scrap of paper." When
then the English Ambassador, on July 1, 1914,
told Bethmann-Hollweg plainly that if Germany
invaded Belgium, England would have
no other course than to join her armies to
those of Belgium and France, the German
Prime Minister exclaimed, "And declare war
for what? For just a scrap of paper!" We
now know that Germany signed treaties for
purposes of diplomatic camouflage, to blind
the eyes of other governments while she was
making ready her weapons for attack. Most
significant that speech in the Reichstag on
July 31, 1914, that contains this: "We cannot
longer postpone the fulfillment of the
pledge given to Austria at the conference of
July 5th." During all those days, between
July 30th and August 4th, when the Kaiser
was apparently trying to prevent war, Germany
and Austria were secretly preparing
cannon, guns, ammunition, railway trains,
food, and secretly hurrying them to the
front, during three entire weeks, following
the agreement between the Kaiser and the
Emperor. Upon eternal brass, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Germany engraved her own infamy. "We
are now in a state of necessity, and necessity
knows no law. We were compelled to override
the just protest of the Belgian government.
The wrong&mdash;I speak openly&mdash;that we
are committing, we will endeavour to make
good as soon as our military goal has been
reached. Anybody who is threatened as we
are threatened can have only one thought,
how he is to hack his way through,&mdash;how he
is to hack his way through."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Consul to Norway</span></p>

<p>That is why our President, speaking for
the republic, has told Germany plainly that
no treaty signed by the Emperor and his
government means anything whatsoever.
There is no German in the Fatherland or in
the United States but understands thoroughly
that the word of a German statesman is less
than nothing: the shadow of the shade of the
possibility of a cipher. Here is von Bernstorff,
given his papers and sent back to Berlin.
Bernstorff gives out a final interview,
stating that he has the full approval of his
conscience (a favourite expression of German
spies), in that he was carrying away from the
United States the full consciousness that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
had never done one deed or had one thought
save to draw the Fatherland and the great
republic closer together, though all the time
his secret agents had been journeying back
and forth between Washington and Mexico,
carrying bribes, organizing sedition, maturing
plots, looking towards war between Mexico
and Texas, and pledging Carranza that
Germany would restore to her New Mexico,
Arizona and Nevada. Scarcely less horrible
Luxburg's cipher despatch advising Germany
to sink the steamers of the Argentine
Republic, "leaving no trace behind." In
Norway the German Ambassador from Berlin
used his trunk, covered with the red sealing
wax of the Foreign Office, to carry
bombs, and the cultures of glanders and
anthrax to spread disease among the Norwegian
people and to sink their steamers.
In the old days of Cæsar Borgia in Italy,
poisoning was made a fine art. Whenever
the Italian prince coveted a rich man's palace,
diamond ring, beautiful wife or young
daughter, or his villa, he invited the owner
to dine at the palace, having first of all poisoned
the wine or the meat. Now the world
has wakened up to discover that the Borgias
were children in the arts of dissimulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and hypocrisy, and that Germany is the original
inventor of perjury. The Kaiser, Bethmann-Hollweg,
von Bernstorff, and some pro-Germans
in this country have displayed a
form of wickedness so cool, calculated, and
scientific, as to seem the characteristics of
fiends, while their plots to plant bombshells
on our steamers, and kill innocent people by
the hundreds represent such hardened forms
of fiendishness that even the worst thief
would scarcely dare hint at such crimes to
his own accomplice in devilishness.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Germany's Policy Towards the
United States</span></p>

<p>Not less striking the influence of Germany's
philosophy and her Pan-German empire
scheme upon her diplomats in foreign countries.
We need not take the opinion of the
British or Belgian, the French or American
authors. It is enough to ask for the testimony
of the Germans themselves. One of
the most important documents bearing upon
this war is a volume of reminiscences published
seven years before the war began, but
practically unknown in the United States.
This volume is entitled "Experiences at a
German Embassy; ten years of German-American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
diplomacy," by Emil Witte, late
counsellor of litigation; Leipzig, 1907. Probably
not more than two or three thousand of
the author's friends ever bought a copy of
this book, but the volume spreads out before
us like a black map the fact that for ten years
von Holleben and Münsterberg with their
German associates were steadily building up
the organization of all German Americans
preparatory to a time when the war between
the United States and Germany would partake
the character of a Civil War.</p>

<p>This counsellor of litigation tells us that
on the German day, October 6, 1901, Germanism
in the United States was organized
at Philadelphia. The diplomat then tells us
how, directed by the German Ambassador,
he went up and down the United States
organizing in New York, Brooklyn, Chicago,
Milwaukee, Cincinnati and St. Louis the
German Soldiers' Societies of the United
States, and wooing the German-Americans
over to the point where they would see that
their first allegiance was to the Fatherland,
their second to the United States. The
German foreign office and the Kaiser were
constantly sending von Holleben for German-Americans
flags, decorations, gracious letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
medals, invitations to visit Germany and
meet the Royalty&mdash;methods that culminated
in the German law that made it possible for
pro-Germans in this country and for their
sons despite American citizenship to keep
their German citizenship with all the rights
of suffrage in the Fatherland. Very significant
also one sentence in these reminiscences
of this German diplomat: "The
relations between Official Germany and the
emigrant subjects of the Emperor, whether
they have become citizens of the Republic or
not, may lead to serious complications between
Germany and the United States, and to unforeseen
incidents which at any moment may
involve both powers in serious difficulty."</p>

<p>No scholar longer doubts that the German
government fully expected that when war
was declared some six or eight thousand
German-Americans belonging to the German
Societies in the United States would
bring about something akin to Civil War.
This is not to be wondered at in view of the
fact that for years Germany's official representatives
had been receiving from time to
time honours and addresses from the Kaiser
and sending back to Berlin cablegrams
pledging undying faithfulness and loyalty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and affirming their purpose to enthrone
German culture in the United States. This
diplomat quotes in full the address of the
German Ambassador in behalf of the
Kaiser on presenting the German colours
to the German Military Society of Chicago.</p>

<p>"Greetings from the German Emperor!
That is the cry with which I come before
you. His Majesty, my most gracious master,
has ordered me to hand to you to-day the
colour which has been desired by you so
strongly and for so long. The colour is a
token of his Majesty's approval with which
the Kaiser remembers in love and friendship
those who have served in the German Army
and Navy, and those who have fought and
bled for the Fatherland. This colour is to
be the symbol of German faithfulness, German
manliness and German military honour.
His Majesty asks you to accept this colour
as a token of that unity which should prevail
among all German soldiers, to act also abroad
[Think of that "abroad," in Chicago!] in
accordance with the sentiments of German
loyalty and German sense of duty, and to
take for your maxim the word of that
great German, Bismarck: We Germans fear
God, but nothing else in the world. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
let the colour flutter in the wind. In this
moment of enthusiasm let us all sound the
cry that is now on the lips of every old German
soldier; his Majesty, the German Emperor,
William II, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"</p>

<p>The history of no country contains plot so
astounding! Under cover of hospitality the
German guest was planting bombshells in
the home of his host. With infinite cunning,
the German diplomats built a German
kingdom within our kingdom. How thoroughly
they alienated many German-Americans
is proven to-day by this fact, that many
members of the German Societies in the
United States, the moment any American
comes out against Germany, break with the
banker, drop the newspaper, give up the
pew in the church, for while their lips announce
that they are Americans, in their
heart they feel that their first loyalty is to
the Kaiser, and not to our government.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">German Diplomats in the Western
Cities</span></p>

<p>These "Reminiscences" also acquaint
Americans with many other plans to
organize the German-Americans in the
United States preparatory to the day when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Canada and the United States should become
German colonies. Silly as all this seems
to Americans it was very serious to von
Holleben, von Bopp, the recently convicted
German consul, Münsterberg, Boy-Ed, von
Papen and Bernstorff. In discussing the
certainty of war with England, the author
states that Germany is absolutely ready for
such an event as war in America, since this
is necessary. He quotes von Schleinitz as
answering: "I know all this and I know
more. I have spoken with officers in high
positions in Berlin, and I have heard surprising
things. Germany reckons very
strongly upon the support of Germans living
in the western states. We looked at one
another. <span class="smcap">We Knew.</span>"</p>

<p>Little did the people of the United States
realize that in 1907, buried in the German
language, there was being sold in Germany a
volume of reminiscences by a counsellor of
legation at the German Embassy in Washington,
containing these sentences: "Professor
Münsterberg had created a widely spread
organization of espionage in the United
States. Münsterberg had been sent to
America by direct command of the Emperor,
in order to mislead the public of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
United States with regard to Germany's true
policy towards America. He receives five
thousand dollars from Harvard and five
thousand dollars from the Berlin foreign
office." Then follows high praise for Münsterberg
in view of the fact that he was sent
to the United States as a lecturer, as a
camouflage device to conceal the real fact
that he was the new head of the German
spy system in America. Beyond all doubt
he was almost the only one that succeeded
in making his camouflage work of lecturing
so successful as to overshadow the more important
fact that he was the organizer of
the most efficient system of espionage that
the Kaiser has ever had.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">German Philosophy of Militarism
Has Debauched Germany's University
Professors</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>Consider how strangely the Pan-German
scheme has degraded Germany's university
professors. The glory of every great city
and land is its scholars, with their love of
truth, and their stainless lives. We have
had our civilization at the hands of men who
loved the truth supremely, pursued the truth
eternally, and cherished the truth above
their fear of hell or hope of heaven. The
world has its liberty, its science and its law
at the hands of the heroes who preferred the
truth above life. Concerning the patriots,
the reformers and the statesmen, we can
only say they were stoned, they were sawn
asunder, they were crucified in Jerusalem,
poisoned in Athens, tortured in Ephesus,
exiled in Florence, burned at the stake in
Oxford, assassinated in London. But the
iron autocracy and militarism of Germany
made cowards of her university men. An
address has been issued to the civilized
world, signed by ninety-odd German professors.
They receive their salaries from
State endowments. Any hour the Kaiser or
the Chancellor can cut off their income.
When the indignation of the civilized world
flamed out against Germany because of the
rape of Belgium, the German Government
asked these professors to sign a document,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and so degraded were these men through the
German philosophy of militarism and autocracy,
that they obeyed&mdash;losing their souls
to save their salary. And consider what
they signed!</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Moral Cowardice of Scholars</span></p>

<p>By royal command these ninety-three professors
signed a statement saying: "It is
not true that we wronged Belgium." In the
Kaiser's address that he himself published,
we read, "Give no quarter, take no prisoners";
he adds, "Let all who fall into
your hands be at your mercy; make yourself
as terrible as the Huns." This address
was circulated on millions of letter cards
all over Germany. Realizing the mistake
made by the Kaiser these professors signed
a statement saying: "It is not true that our
soldiers ever injured the life of a single
Belgian." Socrates, Savonarola or Lincoln
would have died a thousand deaths upon
the rack, rather than have consented to
sign their names to a lie, but the Kaiser
and the Chancellor had only to command
their servants to lie, and they lied like
slaves. It makes the university professor
ashamed of the German teachers. Think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Harnack and Eucken, with their moral
cowardice and their intellectual subserviency.
Plainly that is what Nietzsche meant when
he said (page 134, "Ecce Homo"), "Every
crime against culture that has been committed
for a hundred years rests upon Germany."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Germany Organizes a Plan to Exterminate
Conscience</span></p>

<p>When her Kaiser and Germany's War
Staff had determined to do evil, to become
world conquerors, and prepared a philosophy
that would justify the crimes necessary
to win the goal, Germany then began
to get rid of any vestige of conscience that
survived from the faith of Martin Luther.
It was not enough to control the philosophers
and scholars, it became necessary to
popularize the new license to lawlessness,
lust and theft. Unfortunately, Germany was
complicated by her treaties with other nations
as to the conduct of war. These
treaties were a thousand times more sacred
than contracts of the merchant for a note
at his bank. Germany had solemnly covenanted
to attack only armies, and to safeguard
and protect hospitals, schools, churches, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the life and property of non-combatants.
The Christian religion, also, as presented by
the German Luther, taught obligations involved
in the Ten Commandments. The
new system of militarism, therefore, could
enter the mind of the German soldier only
when the old ideas of the Ten Commandments,
duty, God, and the obligations to
the weak, as taught by Jesus, had been cast
out. One of the crimes proscribed by civilized
states is the crime of teaching other
men to do wickedness. But the German
Kaiser and War Staff have so far lost their
souls that they have deliberately written a
text-book teaching men murder as a science.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Finally Germany Enthroned Cruelty
Instead of Christ's Law of Pity</span></p>

<p>Having substituted the Prussian theory of
the State for Christianity, having replaced
the eternal God with the word Force, spelt
with a capital "F," having gotten the Devil
all mixed up with God, until the Kaiser
planned Devil deeds and signed God's name
to them, finally Germany decided to slay
humanitarianism, pity, sympathy, and regard
for the poor and weak. Nineteen centuries
ago Jesus taught men that God by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
His dear Son had identified Himself with
the poor and the weak. Taking a little
child, Jesus said, "Take heed that ye offend
not one of my little ones." Christianity is
kindness, and pity. Out of Christ's teachings
came the world's hospitals, the emancipation
of slaves, homes for the aged and the
invalid, schools for orphans, hospitals for the
sick. Jesus' sympathy has journeyed like an
angel of God across the fields of the world,
and God's sweet mercy has fallen like rain
from His heaven to cool men's fevered souls.
Just in proportion as men have gone towards
God, they have gone towards pity and compassion.
Florence Nightingale and Augusta
Stanley enter the smitten hospitals of the
Crimea; Mother Bickerdyke and all her associates
are found on the battle-fields of
our Civil War; John Howard organizes the
Prison Relief movement. Everywhere society
climbs upward upon the golden rounds
of sympathy, and philanthropy.</p>

<p>But Germany despises kindness. She now
bombs hospitals, sinks passenger ships, and
the malignancy of her cruelties has horrified
savages in the South Sea Islands. Over
against the teachings of Jesus therefore put
the German frightfulness. Read the article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by that American physician, who left Germany
last summer by way of Switzerland.
Note that when a train of English soldiers
passed through the town, a train loaded
with prisoners packed in freight cars, without
sanitation, wounded men who had been
without food or drink for three days, men
who, with black lips, begged the German
women for water, that these women held
water just out of reach of these English
soldiers, and then spilling it on the ground,
spat in the faces of these wounded men!</p>

<p>When Germans were marching into a
Belgian village, a German captain ordered
the villagers to go into the church. The
houses were then searched. Unfortunately
no weapons were found, and therefore there
was no excuse for looting the town and
then burning the buildings. The diary of
a German soldier says that his captain
showed him a window opening into the cellar
of a Belgian house, and told him to put a
gun in through the window. A few minutes
later the captain "discovered" the gun, and
taking the weapon into the church told all
the villagers that concealed weapons had
been found, and they must all be shot and
the village destroyed. The German burglar's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
life was sacred, but the honest householder's
life and that of his family were as
nothing, losing all rights because the German
burglar has broken open the door.</p>

<p>This new philosophy of militarism teaches
that crimes become virtues if they promote
the interests of the Fatherland. To accept
the hospitality, to plot arson, bombing and
sedition; to play false to all the higher considerations
of honour, through the treachery
of Bernstorff, von Papen, Boy-Ed, is beautiful
and glorious for a German. The blackest
deeds become sacred because they promote
German interests. So thoroughly has
this philosophy of loyalty to the Fatherland
permeated the German soul in every part of
the world, that&mdash;despite multitudes of large-hearted,
open-minded American citizens who
came hither from German homes to better
their political and industrial conditions, and
who, Germans as they are, gratefully appreciate
and are loyal to the America that has
welcomed them&mdash;there are also thousands of
German-Americans about us from whose
lips you cannot obtain one word of criticism
of the blackest deeds of murder and
arson and treachery by Germany's agents in
this country, or of Germany abroad. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is done for the Fatherland is right, no
matter what crime is involved.</p>

<p>It is precisely to this type that Jesus addressed
His words about the light in men
that had become darkness, and therefore
"how great is that darkness." By this route
Germans have gone downward towards spiritual
apostasy.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Germany's Wolfish Spirit</span></p>

<p>Germany's inspiration seems to be that of
the treacherous wolf. Intellectually we cannot
understand how a shepherd can watch
wolves tearing the throat of the lamb in the
Belgian sheepfold and the French sheepfold,
while he stands by and waits until the wolf
tears some lambs and sheep in the American
sheepfold. When a brave man has seen a
wolf tear the throat of one lamb he ought to
leap from his place of safety and take his
place beside the lamb. Of course, the wolf
has many explanations to offer, but the explanations
of the wolf do not interest some
men. There are some foul diseases, like
slavery, that have to be cut out by the
surgery of war. Militarism and autocracy
are cancers, and God has anointed the
surgeon with ointment, black and sulphurous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
But the surgeon's knife has to be
heated red hot, that it may cauterize the
wounds, lest the patient bleed and die.</p>

<p>"We must choose," said Bernhardi, "between
Napoleon and Jesus."</p>

<p>The people of the United States have
chosen between Militarism and Jesus. Our
fathers chose eighteen centuries ago. They
left the law of the pack behind. They chose
to become the sons of God, and lose their
lives that Christ's little ones might survive.
Hospitals, reforms, schoolhouses for children,
reform acts, emancipation proclamations, the
Declaration of Independence, justice, and
man's redemption are the results. German
militarism is the apotheosis of the law of the
wolf-pack, return to the club and the caveman.
If she succeeds in a return to brute
force, her victory will be the most terrible
calamity that overwhelmed the earth since
that event that Milton describes in his story
of the rebellion in heaven. Every editor and
school-teacher, every priest and minister,
every patriot and parent, should drill into
the minds of children and youth the Kaiser's
original charge and the meaning thereof:
"No quarter will be given, no prisoners will
be taken. Let all who fall into your hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
be at your mercy. Make yourselves more
frightful than the Huns under Attila."
Strange, therefore, the Germans feel so terribly
because men call them Huns! Who
understood their real nature? The Kaiser.
Who branded them on the forehead with
a red-hot iron, "Huns"? Their Kaiser.
Whose bloody fingers were lifted upon their
heads when his mildewed lips christened
them "Hun"? Their Kaiser. Who likened
the German soldiers to bloodhounds held
upon the leash as they strained forward to
tear women and children in Belgium and
France? Their Kaiser. But Jesus said,
Woe unto him that offends against one of
My little ones! And out of the whirlwind
comes the voice of an outraged God, saying
to the invaders, "Here stay thy bloody
waves! Thus far, and no farther!"</p>

<div class="center"><big>III<br />
What the United State and Her
Allies Are Fighting For
</big></div>


<p>Not since Fort Sumter was fired upon
and Bull Run lost have thoughtful
men been so disturbed as to-day. The
breakdown of Russia, the massing of German
troops on the western front, the accumulation
of cannon and munitions against
the day of account, make it certain that the
coming inevitable battle is to be the greatest
battle of the most terrible war that ever
shook our earth. All the issues vital to democracy,
independence, freedom, and self-government
are now at stake. It is a
singular fact that the four liberties won by
our fathers during four wars are now to be
nobly won again, or meanly lost in a single
struggle with Germany. In 1776 our fathers
won freedom upon the land; in 1812 they
fought for the freedom of the seas; in 1846,
in their war with Mexico, they established
the sanctity of frontier lines; in 1861 our
fathers safeguarded liberty for white men by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
extending liberty to black men. In 1898
the young men of this republic lifted a shield
above the little land of Cuba, in the hour
when it was being butchered, just as little
Belgium to-day is being butchered by Germany.
Now, strangely enough, every form
of liberty won by these wars is denied to the
human race by the militarism and autocracy
of Germany.</p>

<p>Once more these forms of democracy must
be reasserted, revindicated and reëstablished.
We expect militarism in folk like the old
Macedonians and Romans, and occasional
outbreaks among Indians and the savages of
the South Sea Islands, but we do not expect
that a nation industrially efficient and claiming
to be civilized should suddenly revert to
savagery, and revive the methods of the cave
man. Society protects itself against the occasional
burglar with his nitroglycerine, dark
lantern, and revolver, by building a jail for
the lawbreaker. Civilized states find that
it is impossible to build jails for nine million
Germans who have become thieves, murderers,
violators of women and children. On
German terms life is not worth living for
the boys and girls of Belgium, France and
Poland. If Germany wins, an eclipse will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pass over the face of the sun. The industrial
nations will have to adopt militarism. The
United States will become one vast armed
camp. Every boy will give three or four
years to the life of the soldier. The Atlantic
Coast and the Pacific must bristle with
forts, and the harbours be filled with mines.
The ploughman in the furrow and the workman
in the factory will have to carry a soldier
upon their shoulders. The whole world
must become one vast volcano, with Berlin
as the crater, spouting forth passion and hate
like lurid lava. Not since Judas brought
Jesus to the piteous tragedy of His cross has
there been an hour so black as this moment
when Germany is trying to crucify mankind
upon a cross of bayonets.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Autocracy and Democracy Incompatible
and Mutually Destructive</span></p>

<p>During the past forty years there have
been in Germany on the one hand, and in the
Allied states on the other, two incompatible
and mutually destructive principles,&mdash;one
named Military Autocracy and the other Democracy.
The conflict between the two was
irrepressible, and our entrance into the war
inevitable. Lincoln once said that a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
divided against itself could not stand; that
the republic could not endure half slave and
half free; that it must become all one thing
or all the other. To-day Europe, and indeed
the world, represent a house divided against
itself. It cannot remain half autocratic and
half democratic; it must become all one
thing or all the other. Either Germany
must conquer England, France and the
United States, and impose autocracy upon
them, and enthrone the Kaiser as the world
emperor, or else the Allies must conquer
Germany, and overthrow autocracy and militarism,
until Germany, and Austria, Bulgaria
and Turkey become truly self-governed. On
that August day in 1914, therefore, it became
morally obligatory upon every patriot, every
city and every nation to make the choice between
autocracy and democracy. In the
hour when the battle lines were set in array,
between autocracy and democracy, on August
4, 1914, neutrality became intellectually absurd
and morally monstrous. Serving both
God and Mammon became unthinkable.
Even after our President declared that we
must make the world safe for democracy, a
few men tried to be neutral, and stretched
out the right hand to Germany and the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
hand to the United States, in the spirit of the
man who declined to choose between hell and
heaven, saying he had friends in both
places. The time has fully come to recognize
that civilization and autocracy are deadly
antagonists. John Milton defined a book as
the precious life-blood of a master spirit,
treasured up and handed on to the future.
"As good almost kill a man as kill a good
book." But the free and democratic institutions
are the precious life-blood of the patriots,
the heroes and martyrs, preserved,
and handed forward, as means for winning
the Golden Age. Better, therefore, a thousand
times, that the Kaiser should murder
mankind than assassinate the free institutions
that manufacture manhood of good quality,
and make human life worth the living.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Strength of Our Enemy</span></p>

<p>The battle line between a military autocracy
and the free government is now set in
array. It is to the last degree important
that our people know the strength of the adversary.
Prudent men never underestimate
their opponents. Brave men want to know
the worst that can be said, truthfully. Let
us confess that Germany with her nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
million soldiers, ammunition accumulated
through twenty-five years of preparation, has
suffered no vital hurt. Three years of battle
have lessened the wealth of the Allied nations,
but vastly increased the treasures of
Germany. This war has cost Great Britain
thirty billions of dollars, it has cost France
twenty billions, it has cost the United States
ten billions. For these billions expended
there has been for the Allies no financial return.
In striking contrast thereto, consider
that if Germany has spent twenty billions
upon this war, she has won another twenty
billions, and even claims to have won thirty
billions. Thus far, her armies, like those of
ancient Rome, have looted four countries.
She has carried away their gold, silver, copper,
iron, steel, stocks, bonds, she has stolen
their locomotives, passenger coaches, freight
cars, wagons, automobiles, with all the goods
of merchants. In the face of her solemn
treaties she has stolen the horses, cattle, oxen,
sheep; she has spoiled the granaries of their
wheat, rye and barley. She has looted the
Belgian and French factories of their machinery,
and carried away the looms from the
mills for cotton, wool and silk. The total
value of the steel mills of Belgium and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
France, with all lathes and stationary engines,
is almost incalculable. She looted the
iron and coal mines of Belgium and France
and the wells of Rumania for the oil; she
has looted the mines of Poland, Rumania and
Serbia of their bronze, lead, zinc, copper.
She has loaded thousands upon thousands of
freight trains with household furniture, agricultural
implements, goods from the merchants'
stores, art treasures from public galleries,
as well as from private houses. In
every city and town, in every store and
farmer's house, the Germans attack first of
all the safety vaults and the little money
chest of rich and poor alike. Germany found
Belgium worth twenty billion of dollars. It
is probable that she has spoiled Belgium of
at least eight billions. The national fortunes
of the invaded territories were estimated at
fifty billions, and most of this, after three
years, is now in the hands of the Germans.
Each attack made by Germany has been
against a rich people whose treasure she
could loot, while every attack made by the
Allies has been to recover a land already
devastated, poor and helpless. In choosing
Napoleon, therefore, rather than Jesus, Germany
chose the motto of aggressive warfare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and has made war an investment too profitable
to be readily abandoned.</p>

<p>The peril to the Allies is the greater because
of the vicious methods used by Germany.
All military experts know that wars
are fought incidentally with guns at the
trenches, but in reality with granaries at the
rear. Better a million well-fed men with
naked fists than two million of armed men
who are starving, for the starving men will
soon be too weak to lift the guns and the
well-fed men will grasp the weapons. From
the view-point of food resources, Germany
has from the beginning occupied a unique
position, in that she is rimmed all around
about with little nations unprepared and unarmed,
and therefore impotent to protect
their granaries and root cellars, their herds
and flocks, when Germans came in to steal
them. Whenever Germany has, therefore,
been short of food, she has organized an
expedition and looted some land like Belgium,
as Poland. The next winter she sends
an army out to loot Rumania. Now that
the harvests have been gathered in upon the
fields of Italy, Germany is trying to despoil
that land.</p>

<p>Whenever she has had to withdraw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
million men from the fields to send them to
the front Germany has impressed another
million from Belgium, Poland or Rumania,
and forced these slaves to plough her fields,
reap her harvests, and all without wage.
Sometimes she has gone through the form
of buying grain from the Balkan States, but
she has forced these peoples to take in return
paper currency, which she can grind out so
long as the printing presses hold out and
which in the event of defeat she can easily
repudiate. On the other hand, when Turkey
and Bulgaria have turned towards Germany
for guns and munitions, since they had
nowhere else to go, Berlin has forced their
rulers to pay in gold and silver. Germany's
claim is probably true, that her people are as
well-fed during the fourth winter of the war
as they were during the first winter. These
are not pleasant matters to consider, but
these are the facts. Wise men want to
know the facts, and then they know what
plans they must make to overcome the
worst and turn it into the best. Better be
a wise pessimist than an ignorant optimist.
Uninformed Micawbers always waiting for
something to turn up have no place in this
world war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The query, How goes the battle? involves
the statement that Germany is now fighting
this war at the expense of her neighbours.
Her great Krupp factories are using enormous
quantities of coal, but it is Belgian
coal. Every week she consumes vast stores
of rich iron ore, but it is French ore. Her
motors, trucks, military cars, consume oceans
of oil; this oil comes from Rumania. Each
month she burns up human muscles in field
and factory and shop, but these spent men
and women are subject peoples. In a thousand
ways events are worked for her interests.
Because she is in the center it is
very easy for Germany to transport her
troops from one front to another, while it is
very difficult for the United States to transport
munitions and guns and food across an ocean
3,000 miles in width. It is a conservative
statement to say that it does not cost Germany
one-tenth as much to move a cannon
from Essen to Ypres as it costs the United
States to move a machine gun from Bridgeport
to Cambrai and Verdun.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that we are building
our iron ships with $6 a day labour, our
wooden ships with $7 a day carpenters,
while Germany is impressing labourers from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Belgium and forcing them to work like
slaves. Slowly she is starving them to
death, while pretending to pay them seven
cents a day for their eighteen hours of toil.
When one group of men breaks down and
dies, Germany simply forces at the point of
the bayonet another group to take their
places. Brutality, savagery, have an enormous
advantage over civilized States. One
wolf is equal to a hundred sheep and a thousand
lambs. Thus far Germany has not lost
one inch of territory, and this fact must be
considered when we raise the question as to
how goes the battle.</p>

<p>Ignorant of the real situation, underestimating
the peril that is upon the United
States, many of our citizens refuse to support
the government, discourage enlistment on
the one hand, or else carry about with them
an atmosphere of ignorant optimism. They
talk loudly about America winning this war.
They never tire of telling about our one
hundred millions of people, our two hundred
and fifty billions of wealth, our possible
ten millions of soldiers, and upon the basis
of these considerations they count the war
ended, and win battles by waving perils into
thin air. Others say that in a moral universe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
injustice and cruelty cannot be victorious,
and that in the nature of the case Germany
must be beaten, quite forgetting that
Belgium has been beaten, and so have Alsace
and Lorraine. It is a truism that what has
been may be. A just God permitted the
first republic, Athens, to be ruined by her
military neighbour, Macedonia. The story
how the militarism of Macedonia brought
about the fall of Athens, and contributed to
dark ages, makes up a black page in the
history of liberty.</p>

<p>The ruthless hand of militarism snuffed
out all the torches in the temples of intellect
that once "looked down on Marathon, as
Marathon looks on the sea." What scholar
does not thrill with pain at the very thought
of the brutal regiments that destroyed the
temples, the libraries, the statues, the galleries
of Athens! Phocion believed, as did
Plato and his pupils, that society had outgrown
forever brute force, wars and savagery.
Athens put her emphasis upon the
intellect. She founded schools, and made
her sons to be scholars. She became the
mother of the arts, science and philosophy,
and prided herself upon her artists and statesmen.
She established foreign colonies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
builded ships and extended her trade to far-off
lands in Sicily, Spain, Gaul and North
Africa. Within a century Athens became
the center of eloquence, poetry, philosophy
and liberty. One day Prince Philip from
Northern Macedonia visited Athens. He
marvelled that the city should be like a vineyard
whose purple clusters were without a
fence, whose treasure boxes were without
watchmen. In that hour of avarice and
ambition Philip remembered the soldiers in
his father's army at home. He believed
that one soldier could conquer a dozen merchants,
bankers, statesmen and scholars.</p>

<p>Returning to Macedonia, Philip craftily
began taking an interest in Greek affairs&mdash;for
he was a subtle politician&mdash;and at the same
time turned his whole people into one vast
fighting machine. His unit was the Macedonian
Phalanx. First came twenty-four
men, with short spears; then came a second
twenty-four, with spears of six feet; then a
third twenty-four, with spears of eight feet in
length. The last tier of men in the company
had spears twenty feet long, resting upon
the shoulders of the men in the front rank.
These bristling spears were invincible. The
terror of the Macedonian Phalanx went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
into all the earth. Demosthenes was the one
man who had vision. He called the people
together upon the public square and assembled
them in the great theatre. He mounted
the rostrum upon Mars Hill and warned
Athens. He called the attention of the people
to the fact that between Athens on the
south and Macedonia on the north were three
buffer states. As the Macedonian army moved
southward, these states organized their army
and went forth in defence of their homes and
their firesides. But Demosthenes insisted
that these buffer states were fighting not
only their own battles, but also the battles of
Athens. If they fall, if their armies are defeated,
then Athens, single-handed, must
meet the entire force of the victorious host.
Nevertheless Athens delayed, and would not
be persuaded. The noblest orations of the
greatest man of his time, Demosthenes, were
of no avail.</p>

<p>When he crossed his southern frontier,
Philip made himself terrible. The flames of
the burning towns at midnight lighted up the
land as a terrible warning. Thirty-two towns
that had flourished as commercial communities
vanished from the face of the earth.
These border states above Athens, answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to our modern Belgium, were made into
a desert. Terrorized into submission, the
Greeks threw down their arms and opened
the gates of their cities to Philip's soldiers,
who brought with them women and children
in fetters that the spirit of Athens might be
utterly broken.</p>

<p>Has there ever been in historic times any
parallel quite so striking as that between the
organized militarism of Macedonia with the
subsequent ruin of Athens, and the present
systematized militarism of Germany, now
attempting the ruin of Belgium, France and
England? Listen to Professor von Stengel,
the German authority on International Law:
"There will be no conference at The Hague
when this war is over. The one condition
of prosperous existence for the natives is submission
to our [Germany's] supreme direction.
Under our overlordship all international law
would become superfluous, for we of ourselves,
and instinctively, will give to each
nation its own rights."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">What it Means to America</span></p>

<p>The acuteness of our peril was well set
forth in a conversation that took place last
year between an aged German officer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Franco-Prussian war and a French officer
who won his medal in the same campaign,
both of whom had sought a rest in the village
of Vevey upon the banks of Lake Geneva.
For weeks the two old men on their
wheeled chairs had passed each other without
recognition. One morning, it is said, the
German officer saluted. After expressing
sorrow over the losses of the war, solely
"for the purpose of making conversation," as
he claimed, the German officer raised a question.
First of all he insisted that he spoke
merely as a private citizen who loved his
fellow men, and represented in no sense the
rulers in Berlin: "Suppose the German
armies were to withdraw from Belgium and
France, and agree to restore the devastated
regions and repay England for her sunken
ships. Do you think the Allies would then
return to the conditions of 1914, granting
the Fatherland the trade privileges that then
were hers? For," added the officer, "it is
quite certain that Germany could never raise
the billions of indemnity involved in the
restoration of Belgium and France, and
England's ships, unless she was free to buy
raw material, kept her factories intact and
also her three thousand and more passenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
ships, freight ships, sailing vessels and her
battle-ships to protect her fleet."</p>

<p>To all of which, it is said, the Frenchman
answered, in substance, as follows: "What
you really mean is this,&mdash;that if France and
England laid down their arms, and allowed
Germany to keep her land uninvaded, her
fleet intact, that so far from raising ten or
twenty billions to restore Belgium and
France and recompense England, the Kaiser
would simply load one or two millions of
his veterans on the three thousand of his
ships, and sail away to New York, and
assess the twenty or fifty billions on the
American people. You must remember,"
said the French officer, "that England and
France do not betray their friends. They
do not count their treaties 'scraps of paper.'
My country will never consent to hand the
United States over to the armies and the
battle-ships of Germany."</p>

<p>The genuineness of this brief discussion is
beyond all doubt. The time has fully come
therefore for every American and manufacturer
and merchant, every farmer and financier,
to realize that we have <i>got</i> to win this
war, otherwise there will be no United
States. We are unprepared for war or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
self-defense. After ten months of war Secretary
Baker tells us frankly that thus far
we have not one single machine gun completed,
that not until April will there be one
rifle, for each of a little army of a half-million
men, while the other investigations have
brought home the fact that it is the French
and British army that stand between us and
the Kaiser's troops, and that it is England's
battle-ships that hold the Kaiser's war fleet
behind the Kiel Canal. It is the British
bulldog that keeps the German rat in the
Kiel hole. On one side of the American
silver dollar we have written these words,
"In God we trust," and on the other we
should write these words, "And in England's
battle-ships."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Edmund Burke's Words</span></p>

<p>Burke once spoke of civilization as a contract
between three parties, the noble dead,
the living and the unborn. The English
statesmen held that our fathers have a great
stake in this republic. It could not be otherwise.
Washington and Hamilton, Webster
and Lincoln, who struck out the free institutions
of this country, are vitally interested
in their preservation and their future. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
merchant who founds a great business, the
educator who establishes the academy or
college, the architect who rears some capital
or cathedral, the patriot and soldier who
gave their life-blood to preserve their institutions,
the parents and teachers who have reproduced
themselves in their children and
pupils,&mdash;all these have a great stake in society.
Of necessity, each Franklin or Edison
follows with solicitude the tools invented
for the redemption of men from drudgery.
Are not the Pilgrim Fathers interested in
the outcome of their ideas? Has the great
Emancipator no regard for the black race
whom he redeemed? Can the husbandman
lose all interest in the orchard and vineyard
he has planted for the support of succeeding
generations? Little wonder that the Gothic
legend represents the fathers drawing near
to the battlements of heaven to watch every
assault upon liberty in the plains beneath!
From time to time the illustrious souls, redeemed
out of the body, pluck the red roses
from the tree of life, and fling them down
upon those who are struggling on the plains.
When the roses fall upon the arms of the
enemies of liberty they turn to coals of fire,
that burn the hands of tyrants and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
them drop the sword unsheathed to promote
oppression. When the roses fall upon the
gashes of those who fight for humanity they
become medicines that heal all wounds. Our
children, and our children's children to the
last generation also have a great stake in
this republic. Our own generation is at best
a trustee, whose duty it is to safeguard the
institutions won by our fathers, and then to
hand them forward, unimpaired and greatly
enriched, to the generations that come after
us. God weaves the ages upon a loom.
Civilization is a solid texture, that belongs
to the noble dead, to the living, but chiefly
to the unborn. Every motive, therefore, of
reverence and loyalty to our fathers, and of
affection for our children, bids us dedicate
our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honour
to the overthrow of autocracy and militarism,
and the establishment upon abiding
foundations of the institutions of our fathers.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Our Obligation to England</span></p>

<p>Because England has been fighting our
battle for two and a half years, we are now
not only fighting our own battle, but trying
to repay in part our immeasurable debt to
the motherland. Great Britain has been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mother of many republics; all the harvest of
our liberty came from seed corn gathered
in England's harvest fields. Among Pilgrim
Fathers who founded New England were
men educated in Cambridge. We had our
revolt against the autocracy of George the
Third from the inspirations of Oliver Cromwell,
John Pym and John Hampden. Boston
owes a great debt to Sir Harry Vane, whose
statue stands at the entrance of her Public
Library. We borrowed our freedom of the
press from John Milton's noble argument.
Our Declaration and our Constitution are
nothing other than the restatement, in legal
form, of the noble visions that pursued the
soul of John Milton all his life long.</p>

<p>And now that England is steadily winning
and gaining six battles and attacks out of
seven, during the fourth year of the war, the
time has come for the American people and
government to ask themselves this question,&mdash;Shall
we not do in the first year of our war
the things that England did in the third year
and the fourth?&mdash;thus assuring our winning
six times out of seven. At the beginning of
this war, Britain's ammunition was provided
by three government factories and a few
auxiliary firms. "The first 100,000 men,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
sneered at by the Kaiser as "Kitchener's
contemptible little army," were pounded by
fifty German shells for every one shell with
which they could reply. Now England has
over 5,000 factories turning out munitions.
Her capacity for producing high explosives
in October, 1917, was twenty-five times as
great as in the autumn of 1915, while the
expense is one-third. She is now producing
25,000 tons of projectiles every week, and
each new arsenal factory is built with the
thought of turning them over to productive
industrial companies when the war is over.
Her cannons are roaring upon every front in
Europe, as well as in the Balkans, in Palestine,
in Persia and in Africa.</p>

<p>She now has 400,000 automobile trucks, or
lorries, in France and Belgium, and will turn
out 20,000 airplanes during the next year.
Her fleet has increased from 136,000 sailors
to 400,000; and at last, thanks to the deep-sea
bomb, for every slow and old ship Germany
sinks, she has to lose a far more costly submarine.
To-day England has 4,000,000 men
on six fronts and three continents. She has
not simply mobilized her army, but mobilized
the entire nation, and is only beginning to
exert her full power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The lesson for us, from England's experience,
is this: that every factory in the United
States, now turning out luxuries, should be
taken over by the government to turn out
munitions; that every loom and lathe, forge
and hammer, every mine and forest and
shipyard should be dedicated to this one
task&mdash;of winning this war for humanity and
liberty. History will doubtless say that
during the first two and a half years of this
war America was like the priest and the
Levite who passed by on the other side,
leaving Belgium like the wounded man
lying among thieves, while England was the
Good Samaritan, glorious forever through her
service, self-sacrifice and loyalty to her written
pledges. We owe Great Britain and her
colonies a debt of service because she placed
her army and her navy between us and our
enemy and preserved us. When, therefore,
an occasional pro-German, who does not
dare defend the Kaiser, stands on the street,
and in his harangue vilifies Great Britain,
we should remember that the Allied cause
has three armies, Haig's, Petain's and Pershing's.
Whoever vilifies one of the hosts is
the enemy of all three. When General
Grant found one of his aids chuckling over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the news of a defeat of Sheridan, Grant
court-martialed the man, found him guilty,
shot him at daybreak,&mdash;an example to be
commended with reference to any man who
vilifies Great Britain or France with his lips
or pen. In this crisis there are no German-Americans,&mdash;there
are only Americans and
traitors. The first duty of our government
is to defend our transports, our soldiers and
sailors, from all spies, American with their
lips, but with hearts full of hatred for our
Allies and our country.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">We Are Also Fighting to Pay
Our Debt to France</span></p>

<p>Fighting to protect the institutions of our
fathers and to safeguard democracy for our
children, we are also fighting to expel invaders
from France, as once France helped
Washington expel thousands of German invaders
from America. How black the sin
of ingratitude! What if some youth, poor
and obscure, coming up to the great city to
make his fortune, should gain his opportunity
to climb at the hands of some noble
merchant. And what if this benefactor,
taking the orphan into his home, shares his
treasure with the youth, builds manhood in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the poor boy, opens to him the door to
fortune and to fame. And what if, when
the poor boy finally has a mansion of his
own, with wealth, and honours, news should
come that his now aged benefactor has fallen
on evil days and been attacked by cruel
enemies. Can any crime be blacker than
for this strong man to send word to the one
upon whose shoulders he had climbed up to
place, saying, "I do not wish to enter into
any entangling alliances with you in your
distress, for I have learned neither to borrow
nor to lend"?</p>

<p>In 1781 France, a kingdom rich and
powerful, found the handful of American
colonists in the condition of a boy, poor,
friendless, obscure, and threatened by a
powerful enemy. Washington had no
money, no guns, no powder, no shoes for
his soldiers in the winter. At the moment
when our fortunes were at the lowest ebb,
France sent us her greatest admiral, with
a fleet of two battle-ships, three destroyers,
thirty-eight transports, and seven thousand
soldiers, with muskets, powder, shot, shoes,
clothing and medical supplies. She sent us
Lafayette, heir to rich estates, with one of
the largest private incomes in Europe, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
with his fellow officers, joined the troops of
Washington. He saw his Frenchmen fall
side by side with the troops of Washington.
When at length Cornwallis surrendered his
sword to the Commander of our army,
Lafayette shared in the ceremony. What
treasure of lives and fortune France lavished
upon this republic more than one hundred
years ago! We owe France our generals,
our admirals, our soldiers and sailors, our
munitions, our physicians, our nurses, our
admiration, our love, our lives and our
sacred honour.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The World's Love for France</span></p>

<p>If Germany is the best hated nation in the
world, so France is the most dearly loved
country. From France we have our painting
at the hands of her artists, from France
we have our sculpture at the hands of Rodin.
From France we have fine literature and
music; from France we have the beautiful,
organized into the clothes the people wear.
But above all, France has given us the enduring
things of the spirit. The whole history
of heroism holds nothing finer than the
tales of French soldiers struggling unto blood
and death to secure happiness and liberty for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
others. Where will you find a more glorious
sentiment than this, that fell from the lips
of the poilu in the trenches,&mdash;"We sleep
in mud, we bathe in blood, but our souls,
they dwell among the stars." Here is that
young French girl, going to the station, the
Garde du Nord, to meet her wounded husband,
who had never seen his new-born babe.
But the young fellow died while they lifted
him out of the car. Putting the little babe
down to the cheek that was becoming cold,
the girl lifted her eyes unto God, and with
streaming eyes exclaimed, "I am only his
wife! France is his mother!" And here is
that poilu home for his eight days' rest, who
saw the broken-down hearse, with a poor
little woman hidden under crêpe, marching
as the sole mourner; the soldier sprang
up, rushed to the hearse, saw a crippled
comrade who had been killed at the battle
of the Somme, and turned to bid all the
men and women on the sidewalk fall into
line, because a soldier of France was sleeping,
and all Frenchmen were his lovers, and
who carried the poor man in triumphal procession
in the midst of sorrowing hundreds
to his final resting place. The French have
added a new chapter to the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
heroism. The Hun will never conquer
France. Should a time ever come when the
butchers have killed all save one French boy
and girl, when the weapon is lifted against
them, they will stand against the wall of the
Pyrenees, and the last Frenchman might die,
but he will never be conquered by the Huns.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Tribute of the British</span></p>

<p>Americans oftentimes marvel at the praise
that the British and the French bestow upon
the armies of the other. Each insists upon
considering the other superior to himself.
One August day, in a Paris restaurant, a
young English captain, quiet, reserved, modest
to a degree, was praising the French soldiers
and officers whom he had met. Having
just returned from the front of Ypres and La
Bassée he was so filled with admiration for
the fortitude, the endurance, and the heroism
of the French soldiers, that he sought in
vain for words bright enough with which to
describe their achievements. Asked for the
reason of his eulogy, and his conviction as
to the supremacy of the French, the British
captain answered, "You must remember that
the Frenchman is fighting for his native
land, while England has never been invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
by the Huns." Then the captain went on to
praise the British rifles, machine guns, their
military tactics, and the skill of their soldiers.
"When my company march, they
are so perfectly drilled that their one hundred
right legs swing like the single stroke
of a pendulum. I will put my men against
the soldiers of the world. Still," he said,
"so far as I now recall, no English division
ever brought in at one time more than one
fourth their number as prisoners."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Picture of the French Fight</span></p>

<p>"But," added the captain, "look at the
French soldiers at Verdun. One had a helmet,
one a hat, some were bareheaded; some
had new rifles, some old rifles, and some only
a bayonet and revolver. When they were
within ten rods of the German trench they
lifted up their bayonets and sent out their
battle cry, and hearing the hoarse voices,
the Germans flung away their guns, climbed
out of their trenches, ran like rabbits and
bellowed like bulls; that night when the
French division came home for supper, they
brought ten thousand Germans along with
them. You can't beat the French&mdash;they are
fighting for their native land." That is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
reason, but it is not <i>the</i> reason. The reason
is this&mdash;the Frenchman counts himself dead
already. If he survives to-day's battle, he
says, The morrow will give me another
chance to die for God and beautiful France.
The Frenchman never knows when he is defeated,
and therefore he cannot be beaten.</p>

<p>One day a lawyer from Paris came to the
front to bring Jean a message from a cousin.
"The Americans have come, the Latin Quarter
is reviving, the shops are reopening, and
your cousin offers to take down the shutters
that have been up for three years and try
to make a little money to take care of you
if you are wounded, and have it ready for
you when you return." Jean shook his
head,&mdash;he was not interested. He said that
he never expected to return; that his cousin
must take the shop, that everything therein
was hers; that he asked only to die for
France. The lawyer could not reason with
him, and so the attorney hastily wrote out
a paper, giving the cousin full power to act
as if the property were hers, and then the
French soldier hurried back to the trenches,
having no time for even a farewell. If to-day
every civilized city and country looks
with contempt upon Germany, and thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of her as a wild beast let loose to rend the
white flesh of humanity, every country in
the world hails France, and admires and
loves her for her chivalry, her heroism, her
fortitude and her faith.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Next Step</span></p>

<p>In this critical hour national unity is become
an imperative necessity. Men who
have travelled up and down the country
realize the intense patriotism of one city
and section, and the apathy of another section.
Always the explanation is to be found
in the fact that some outstanding newspaper
or public man has become the center of enlightenment
and patriotism or the reverse.</p>

<p>As for the papers, the cost of the cablegrams,
the expense of telegraphing news
across the country into the South, the West,
or the Pacific Coast cities, the high price of
print paper, has all but destroyed the financial
resources of many papers, in towns west
of the Alleghanies. But the flame of enthusiasm
is fed by the fuel of ideas. The
men who sacrifice are the men who know.
The time, therefore, would seem to have
come for the government, during the period
of the war, to see to it that the people in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
villages, rural districts, and remote towns,
should receive the full facts, every morning,
so that daily one hundred millions of people
should be assembled in one vast speaking
gallery, and rise to the news of the same
victory, and resolve with one mind and one
heart to defend humanity. All the millions
must think as one, and feel as one, and save
and serve and sacrifice, and have one resolve
to back up our President in the pledge to
make democracy safe for our earth.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Mobilizing of the Women</span></p>

<p>To win this war our girls and women must
join the world movement. The outstanding
lesson of the first two years of the war for
Great Britain and France is that the beginning
of their victories came with the
entrance of women into the war. The steel
wedge splits the log, not alone by the sharp
edge, but the thick head that crowds forward
the cutting edge. The American army is the
cutting edge, but the one hundred millions of
people behind lend driving power to our regiments.
There are three million women in
Great Britain either in the munition factories
or industries allied thereto. Every twenty-four
hours they produce more small cartridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
than all England did the first year of the war.
Every two days they turn out more large
cartridges than all England did the first year
of this war. Every six days, with the help
of expert men, they produce more heavy
ordnance and cannon than all England did
the first year of this war. These English
women pour the molten steel, tool the shells,
run the lathes, make the aeroplanes, mix the
explosives, and they literally hand the shells
to the British soldiers to aim the cannon.
They are driving the munition trucks upon
the streets of England and the road to
France, they are sowing the fields, reaping
the wheat, threshing the grain, and performing
ten thousand tasks once given over
to men. The daughters of professional men,
bankers, manufacturers, as well as of the
business classes, are helping to equip the
soldiers at the front. If our government
should to-morrow commandeer ten thousand
luxury-making plants for munition factories,
throw them open to millions of women, by
next autumn we should be doing our part to
help win this war.</p>

<p>To-day the clouds are thick, but better
days are coming. For a time it may be our
lot to toil on in the wilderness, but soon or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
late the pilgrim host will enter the Promised
Land and hang out the signals of victory.
Those who war for justice and humanity
find that the stars in their courses fight with
them, and their soldiers shall be fed on
angels' bread. Truth is stronger than error,
liberty is stronger than tyranny, justice is
the genius of our universe, God is omnipotent,
and at last, love and sympathy must prevail.
In this faith we must strive on for a peace
that shall defend frontier lines, vindicate the
rights of little peoples and destroy militarism
and autocracy. During the January snowstorms,
that noble surgeon and poet, at the
head of a hospital at Vimy Ridge,&mdash;Dr. now
Sir Andrew Macphail&mdash;wrote me a letter
which stayed my heart as the anchor holds
the ship in time of storm. The ground was
deep with snow. Many wounded men had
been brought in from the trench. But at
midnight, while the winter's wind flapped
his tent, the physician wrote me thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This war is of God. To-day it is
peace that is hell. The soldier's life is a
life of poverty, obedience, self-sacrifice;
we know what the civilian's life is. But
for the chastisement of this war, Berlin
and Vienna, London and Paris would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
have descended into hell within three
generations. I once spoke in your Plymouth
on the blessings of peace; if ever
again I have that privilege, I shall speak
on the blessings of war. I never dreamed
that men could be so noble. For three
months I have slept on the stone; for
three months before that in a tent; for six
months I have not been in a bed; but I
have never been so happy. I have acquired
the fine freedom of a dog, and
like a dog, I wear a metal tag around
my neck so that they may know to
whom I belong when it happens that I
can no longer speak. And never was a
man engaged in a cause so noble. I have
seen Belgium; I have seen a lamb torn
by the wolf; I am on the side of the
lamb. I know the explanations the
wolf has to offer&mdash;they do not interest
me. I only wish that you were here
with me at this battle for your own
good; for right here at this western
front this war will be decided, just
where all the great wars of history have
always been decided. It is decided already,
but will take the enemy some time
yet to find it out."</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Vision of a Just and Lasting Peace</span></p>

<p>What does this noble scholar mean? History
makes that meaning plain! No wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
until the purple clusters are crushed. No
linen until the flax is bleeding and broken.
No redemption without shedding of blood.
No rich soil for men's bread until the rocks
are ploughed with ice glaciers and subdued
with fire billows. Four forms of liberty
achieved by our fathers, for which they paid
over three thousand battle-fields, blood down.
This war was not brought by God, but having
come, let us believe that His providence
can overrule it for the destruction of all war.
When Germany is beaten to her knees, becomes
repentant, offers to make restitution
for her crimes, then and not till then can
this war stop. Autocracy too must go.
There is no room left in the world for a
kaiser or a sultan. The hangman's noose
awaits the peasant murderer, and already
the hemp is grown to twist into the noose for
the royal neck. At all costs and hazards we
must fight this war through to a successful
issue. Our children must not be made to
walk through all this blood and muck. The
burden of militarism must be lifted from the
shoulders of God's poor. Any state that
will not forever give up war must be shut
out of the world's clearing houses and
markets through finance and trade. Geologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
tell us that the harbour of Naples, protected
by islands, was once the crater of a
volcano like unto Vesuvius, but that God depressed
that smoking basin until the life-giving
waters of the Mediterranean streamed
in and put out that fire. Oh! beautiful emblem
of a new era, when God will depress
every battle-field, and every dreadnought,
and bring in the life-giving waters of peace.</p>

<p>When we have so carried on this war as
to end all wars, a golden age will come, and
with it the Parliament of Mankind, the Federation
of the World, a little international
army policing the land, a little international
navy policing the seas, an international supreme
court deciding disputes between peoples.
To this high end let our sons dedicate
themselves. To this goal let all of us as
parents, looking towards our best beloved,
say, "My son he is! God's soldier let him be!
I could not wish him to a fairer death." Let
all our people say to the Kaiser and his War
Staff, "You shall not skewer babes upon your
bayonets; you shall not crucify officers upon
the trees; you shall not nail young nuns to
the doors of the schoolhouses; you shall not
violate the sanctities of infancy and old age;
you shall not mutilate the bodies of little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
girls and noble women; you shall not call
that unspeakable butcher, the Sultan, a dear
friend, and organize his soldiers for the
assassination of the whole Armenian race;
you shall not play fast and loose with your
solemn treaties; you shall not transfix mankind
with German bayonets; you shall not
crush the hopes of Gladstone, Lafayette and
Lincoln. You shall not grind God's children
beneath the iron heel of despotism. And so
help us God, despite all your atrocities, government
of the people, by the people, and for
the people shall not perish from God's earth!</p>

<p><i>The Butcher's Charge</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1900 addressing his soldiers about to sail for
Peking, the Kaiser gave them counsel. Later he
repeated this in a little different language for the
soldiers of August, 1914: "When you meet the
foe you will defeat him. No quarter will be
given, no prisoners will be taken. Let all who
fall into your hands be at your mercy. Just as
the Huns one thousand years ago under Attila
gained a reputation, so may the name of Germany
become known in such a manner in China
that no Chinaman will ever again dare to look
askance at a German."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Kitchener's Charge</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Be invariably courteous, considerate and
kind. Never do anything likely to injure or destroy
property, and always look upon looting as a
disgraceful act. You are sure to meet with a
welcome, and to be trusted; your conduct must
justify that welcome and that trust. Your duty
cannot be done unless your health is sound. So
keep constantly on your guard against any excesses.
In this new experience you may find
temptations in wine and women. You must entirely
resist both temptations, and, while treating
all women with perfect courtesy, you should
avoid any intimacy.</p>

<p>"Do your duty bravely. Fear God. Honour

<div class="center"><big>IV<br />
Astounding Claims and Records
from German Sources</big>
</div>

<p>Over and over again the German
Chancellor and the Kaiser have declared
that Germany is waging a defensive
war, and never intended to annex Belgium.
Shortly after the death of the Governor of
Belgium a member of the Reichstag published
General von Bissing's memorandum,
signed by its author. This man enjoyed to
an unusual degree the Kaiser's confidence.
In his last testament he declares that King
Albert must be dethroned, dictatorship must
be established, the properties of all Belgians
who have fled must be confiscated, and a
régime of blood and iron imposed, otherwise
Germany has lost the war. "Our frontier
must be pushed forward to the sea. We
must retain all Belgium and link it up with
the German sphere of power. The annual
Belgian production of 23,000,000 tons of coal
has given us a monopoly on the continent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
which has helped us to maintain our vitality.
If we do not hold Belgium, administer Belgium,
and protect Belgium by force of arms,
our trade and industry will lose the position
they have won. Belgium, therefore, must be
seized and held, as it now is, and as it must
be in the future. It only remains for us,
therefore, to avoid, during the peace negotiations,
all discussion about the form of the
annexation, and to talk only about the right
of conquest. In view of our just and ruthless
procedure, the king of the Belgians will
be deposed, and we can read in Machiavelli
that he who desires to take possession of a
country will be compelled to remove the
king, even by killing him."</p>

<p>Nothing can be more obvious, since Machiavelli
also says the burglar often must
kill the householder, and Annas had to assassinate
Jesus; but other murderers from
the day of Socrates to Lincoln have been
more skillful than von Bissing in announcing
and defending their crimes.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Claims of the Kaiser's Family</span></p>

<p>Some years ago, in 1856, Frederick William
IV, a predecessor of the present reigning
"All Highest," became a suitor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
courts of Missouri seeking to recover from
the estate of a deceased postmaster a sum
with which he had absconded to America.
The royal plaintiff thus modestly described
his status: "The plaintiff states that he is
absolute monarch of the Kingdom of Prussia,
and as king thereof is the sole government
of that country; that he is unrestrained by
any constitution or law, and that his will,
expressed in due form, is the only law of that
country, and is the only legal power there
known to exist as law." (<i>King of Prussia v.
Kuepper's Admr., 22 No. 551.</i>) See Law

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here follow a very few out of thousands
of thoughts and records of fact, written by
Germans, and still existing&mdash;mostly in print&mdash;originally
designed to arouse the German
war-spirit or to chronicle its achievements.

Its revelations are undeniable.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Germany Announces Her Plan to

<p>Let us bravely organize great forced migrations

will be grateful to us. We must coerce them!
This is one of the tasks of war; the means
must be superiority of armed force. Superficially
such forced migrations, and the penning
up of inconvenient peoples in narrow
"reserves" may appear hard; but it is the
only solution of the race-question that is
worthy of humanity.... Thus alone can
the over-population of the earth be controlled;
the efficient peoples must secure
themselves elbow-room by means of war,
and the inefficient must be hemmed in, and
at last driven into "reserves" where they
have no room to grow ... and where, discouraged
and rendered indifferent to the
future by the spectacle of the superior energy
of their conquerors, they may crawl slowly
towards the peaceful death of weary and
hopeless senility.&mdash;<i>K. Wagner, K., p. 170.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Germany Announces Her Semi-Slave

<p>[In the All-German Confederation which

feeling they had in the Middle Ages of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Germany Proposes to Disarm Other

<p>The war must last until we have forced

nursery rhyme which runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
Knife and scissors, fork and candle,<br />
Little children must not handle.<br />

<p>Since the enemy States behave so childishly
as to misuse their arms, they must be placed

that rights of citizenship should be denied
them.... When they can no longer bear

<p>"As I walked out, General von Bernhardi

met him the next morning and he asked
me if I had read his book 'Germany in the
Next War.' I said I had. He answered,
'Do you know, my friends nearly ran me
out of the country for that. They said,
"You have let the cat out of the bag." I
replied, "No, I have not, because nobody

may it please our Great Ally, who stands
behind the German battalions, behind our
ships and U-boats, and behind our blessed
"militarism"!&mdash;<i>E. v. Heyking, D. W. E.,
p. 23.</i></p>

<p>The German soul is the world's soul, God
and Germany belong to one another.&mdash;<i>"On
the German God," by Pastor W. Lehmann,
quoted in H. A. H., p. 83.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Testimony of Affidavits, and Diaries
Taken from the Bodies of German
Soldiers, as to the Atrocities</span></p>

<p>(<i>D. 25-54.</i>) A boy with his hands cut off,
mutilated by a German officer, because he
was supposed to have laughed at this drunken
brute.</p>

<p>(<i>D. 4, 5.</i>) A Belgian babe, skewered upon
the bayonet, driven through his stomach,
with his little dead head and hands and legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
dangling as the German proudly carried it
through the street of a village.</p>

<p>(<i>Alcove C. 60.</i>) A Mother Superior crucified
by bayonets to the door of her schoolhouse
as punishment for scratching the face
of an officer who was violating the person of
a young nun. The burning alive of a man
who defended his wife.</p>

<p>(<i>D. 92-93. Also D. 100-108.</i>) Photographs
of an aged priest, staked down to the ground,
and used as a lavatory until he was dead;
photographs and affidavits of young girls
with one breast cut off.</p>

<p>(<i>Affidavits in Alcove 867.</i>) The dead body
of a young girl nailed by her hands to the
outside door of a cottage. She was about
fourteen or sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>(<i>Page 21. Affidavits H-67.</i>) "September
14th. One hundred and eight inhabitants
are stated to have been shot after they had
dug their own graves. Innumerable houses
have been destroyed. The population looks
bitter and scowling." August 22nd, notebook
of Private Max Thomas. "Our soldiers
are so excited, we are like wild beasts.
To-day, destroyed eight houses, with their
inmates. Bayonetted two men with their
wives and a girl of eighteen. The little one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
almost unnerved me, so innocent was her expression."</p>

<p>(<i>D. 10. 45.</i>) In retreating from Laines eight
drunken soldiers were marching through the
street. A little child of two years came out
and a soldier skewered the child on his bayonet,
and carried it away while his comrades
sang.</p>

<p>Withdrawing from Hofstade, in addition
to other atrocities the Germans cut off both
hands of a boy of sixteen. At the inquest
affidavits were taken from twenty-five witnesses,
who saw the boy before he died or
just afterwards.</p>

<p>(<i>Affidavits D. 100-8.</i>) Passing through
Haecht, in addition to the young women
whom they violated and killed, a child three
years old was found nailed by its hands and
feet to a door.</p>

<p>That all these atrocities were carefully
planned in advance for terrorizing the people
is proven by the fact that on the morning of
August 25th the officers who had received
great kindness from Madame Roomans, a
notary's wife, warned her to make her escape
immediately, as the looting and killing of all
the citizens, men, women and children, was
about to begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>D. 186.</i>) "The captain served a requisition
upon all the farmers hereabouts, taking
horses, oxen, wagons, milk and butter. These
people are so ignorant that they did not
know when he gave them false receipts and
signed this name&mdash;Herr von Koepenick."
Other peasants received receipts stating that
in return for the goods that had been requisitioned
by the German officers, the owner
was to come to the German quartermaster
and receive his pay in twenty strokes of a
whip-lash. If all the diaries of the Germans
now in the hands of the English, Belgian
and French authorities were brought together
and published, they would make a
small library, and the title would be "Confessions
of Crime by German Soldiers."</p>

<p>"August 19th. Halted and plundered a
villa, as invariably the surrounding houses
were immediately plundered; dined splendidly,
drank eleven bottles of champagne,
four bottles of wine and six bottles of liquor."</p>

<p>John VanderSchoot, 10th Company, 39th
Infantry, 7th Army Corps. "August 19th.
Quartered in the University. Boozed through
the streets of Liège, lie on straw, booze in
plenty, little food, so we must steal. We live
like gods here in Belgium."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>K. Bartel&mdash;on crimes he had witnessed&mdash;as
they were committed by his own officers
and fellow privates. "Our men have shrunk
morally below zero. Oct. 7th."</p>

<p>Yager Otto Clepp, August 22nd, in Liège
makes this entry: "Two of our regiments
shot at each other; nine dead and fifty
wounded. Reason for mistake not yet ascertained."</p>

<p>There is a striking commentary on the
German War Staff's Commission's statement
that they shot the old men and women in
Liège because of an attack by the people.
This German officer's entry illustrates what
doubtless happened many times. When the
Germans were drunk, terrified by the sense
of their own crimes and expecting the people
to resist the cruelties, one German company
turned and fired upon another.</p>

<p>H. W. Heller. August 6th. "Friday at
8:30 came the news that the English had
landed in Belgium. We smashed everything
immediately. One sees only burning houses
and heaps of dead people and dead horses
every three steps."</p>

<p>Fritz Holman writes: "We are never
thirsty here in France. We drink five and
six bottles of champagne a day, and as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
under linen, we simply loot a house and
change. God only knows what will happen
unto us later on."</p>

<p>Stephen Luther's diary. "Monday the 10th.
Marching via Laden. Villages friendly disposed,
one of them bombarded in error. Misunderstandings
occurred because our officers
understand no French. There was terrible
destruction; in a farmhouse saw a woman
who had been completely stripped and who
lay on burnt beams. How savage! Terrible
conditions in the destroyed houses."
"August 24, 1914. In Ermiton we took
about a thousand prisoners. At least five
hundred were shot."</p>

<p>Let this series be closed by a few trenchant
words from two of Germany's most
famous poets, characterizing the Prussian
nature that to-day controls all Germany
(and neighbour Austria besides). The great
Goethe was from Weimar, but the satiric
Heine, from Düsseldorf&mdash;a Prussian, born.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Prussianism</span></p>

<p>"The Prussians are cruel by nature; civilization
will make them ferocious."&mdash;<i>Goethe.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Prussians ... Nature made
them stupid, science has made them wicked."&mdash;<i>Heinrich
Heine.</i></p>

<p>"Christianity has to a certain extent softened
this brutal, belligerent ardour of the
Teutons, but it has not been able to destroy
it; and when the Cross&mdash;the talisman that
fetters it&mdash;shall be broken, then the ferocity
of the old-time fighters, the frenzied exultation
of the Berserkers, whose praises are still
sung by the poets of the North, will again
burst forth. Then&mdash;and alas! this day will
surely come&mdash;the old war gods will arise
from their legendary tombs and wipe the
dust of ages from their eyes; Thor will arise
with his gigantic hammer and demolish the
Gothic Cathedral."&mdash;<i>Heinrich Heine.</i></p>

<p>After the mephitic horrors of the German
war-spirit, let us be refreshed by a breeze
from the shores of America, and gratefully
recognize a characteristic American flavour
in the following address from Major-General
Pershing to his troops in France. The report
is from a French paper, and while,
through its double translation, it may not be
verbally exact, its fine spirit is evident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are now in France, to expel an
enemy that has invaded this beautiful land.
Your first duty is to fight against this foe,
and protect our Ally. You are here also to
lift a shield above the poor and weak. You
will be kind, therefore, to the aged and the
invalid. You will be courteous to all women,
and never have so much as an evil thought
in your mind. You will be very tender and
gentle with little children. You will do
well, therefore, to forswear the use of all
liquors. You will do your duty like brave
men. Fear God. Honour your country.
Defend liberty. God have you in His
keeping."</p>

<h3>CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS AFLAME</h3>


<p>Imagination is not Germany's gift....
She cannot by any chance conceive how other
races look upon her vandalism. Her own
foreign secretary expressed it: "Let the neutrals
cease chattering about cathedrals. Germany
does not care one straw if all the galleries
and churches in the world were destroyed,
providing we gain our military ends."&mdash;Pp.

<h3>GERMAN MILITARY TACTICS</h3>

<p>The official Handbook for instruction and
guidance says: "By steeping himself in military
history, an officer will be able to guard
himself against excessive humanitarian notions."&mdash;These
four citizens were murdered
because they would not betray the guardianship
of their bank.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_23">23</a>.</p>

<h3>A GUILTY HOME GUARD</h3>

<p>This man defended his home and the honour
of his young wife against two German officers.
They literally carved his limbs into bits, and
mutilated his body in ways that men only
speak of, and then in whispers. When the
German marauder breaks into the French or
Belgian home, its owner of course loses his
rights: All belong to the brave conquerors.</p>

<h3>A PRINCELY WEAPON</h3>

<p>The German firebrand is a perforated iron
bulb, filled with asbestos cloth absorbing
about a teacupful of petrol. Mounted on a
wooden handle it is fired, and hurled into a
building for conflagration. With this Prince
Eitel Frederick, after looting, personally burned
the Chateau of Avricourt, where he had quartered
for months.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_45">45</a>.</p>

<h3>RUINS OF GERBÉVILLER</h3>

<p>This once lovely village of Gerbéviller, is
now called Gerbéviller the Martyred. In a
rage of fury because of his enforced retreat
before a French army, of two-thirds in number
of his own troops, General Clauss looted
this little city and massacred about one hundred
of its people. Among the slain were
fifteen very aged men, including the Mayor
and his secretary, there being no young or
middle-aged men left in the town who could
be killed. Out of 475 houses, twenty at most
were left habitable.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_37">37</a>.</p>

<p>Two examples of wanton, unmilitary destruction.
Above, a scene in Nomeny (Department
of Meurthe-et-Moselle), and below,
the splendid great Cloth Hall of Ypres.
The former was simply the hell-blast of German
passage; the latter, a distinct intention
to destroy by fire a famous and beautiful
edifice, made a target for the heaviest guns,
with no remotest military reason&mdash;except
"frightfulness."</p>

<h3>MUTE WITNESSES</h3>

<p>The full extent of the German atrocities
committed on a battle line six hundred miles
in length, and extending from the English
Channel to the Swiss frontier, can never be
known. More than one hundred thousand
people are simply reported as "missing,"
other multitudes were burned or thrown into
pits. Only in towns from which the German
armies hurriedly retreated were inquests possible,
and in those towns affidavits were prepared
and photographs of the mutilated bodies
taken. After the German troops had passed
out of the village or city, it became possible
for the village school-teacher, priest or banker,
the aged women and the children to creep out
of pits, the caves in the fields, or the edge of
the woods, where they had been hiding, and
return to survey the scene of desolation behind
them. The opposite page shows victims
in the little town of Andenne, where more than
300 civilians were massacred.</p>

<h3>CATHEDRAL OF ST. MARTIN</h3>

<p>The city of Ypres, in the intensest zone of
conflict, has suffered much. The ancient
Cathedral, of the XIII Century, on the site of
an edifice of the XI, stately and impressive
with its magnificent rose window in the choir,
is now unroofed and its fine interior a heap of
stones mournfully guarded by the remaining
pillars and broken walls. The great altarpiece
of St. Martin on his white steed still
presides over the ruins of the high altar. It
is a ghastly scene.</p>
